FOREWORD

Larry Page
Alphabet CEO and Google Cofounder

Iwish I had had this book nineteen years ago, when we founded
Google. Or even before that, when I was only managing myself!
As much as I hate process, good ideas with great execution are

how you make magic. And that’s where OKRs come in.
John Doerr showed up one day in 1999 and delivered a lecture to

us on objectives and key results, and how we should run the
company based on his experience at Intel. We knew Intel was run
well, and John’s talk made a lot of intuitive sense, so we decided
we’d give it a try. I think it’s worked out pretty well for us.

OKRs are a simple process that helps drive varied organizations
forward. We have adapted how we use it over the years. Take it as a
blueprint and make it yours, based on what you want to see happen!

For leaders, OKRs give a lot of visibility into an organization.
They also provide a productive way to push back. For example, you
might ask: “Why can’t users load a video on YouTube almost
instantly? Isn’t that more important than this other goal you’re
planning to do next quarter?”

I’m glad to join in celebrating the memory of Bill Campbell,
which John has done very nicely at the conclusion of the book. Bill
was a fantastically warm human being who had the gift of almost
always being right—especially about people. He was not afraid to
tell anyone about how “full of shit” they were, and somehow they
would still like him even after that. I miss Bill’s weekly haranguing
very much. May everyone have a Bill Campbell in their lives—or
even strive to make themselves be a bit more like the Coach!

I don’t write a lot of forewords. But I agreed to do this one
because John gave Google a tremendous gift all those years ago.
OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They’ve



helped make our crazily bold mission of “organizing the world’s
information” perhaps even achievable. They’ve kept me and the rest
of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most.
And I wanted to make sure people heard that.

Larry Page and John Doerr, 2014.



PART ONE

OKRs in Action



1

Google, Meet OKRs

If you don’t know where you’re going, you might not
get there.

—Yogi Berra

O n a fall day in 1999, in the heart of Silicon Valley, I arrived at
a two-story, L-shaped structure off the 101 freeway. It was
young Google’s headquarters, and I’d come with a gift.

The company had leased the building two months earlier,
outgrowing a space above an ice-cream parlor in downtown Palo
Alto. Two months before that, I’d placed my biggest bet in nineteen
years as a venture capitalist, an $11.8 million wager for 12 percent of
a start-up founded by a pair of Stanford grad school dropouts. I
joined Google’s board. I was committed, financially and
emotionally, to do all I could to help it succeed.

Barely a year after incorporating, Google had planted its flag: to
“organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible
and useful.” That might have sounded grandiose, but I had
confidence in Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They were self-assured,
even brash, but also curious and thoughtful. They listened—and
they delivered.

Sergey was exuberant, mercurial, strongly opinionated, and able
to leap intellectual chasms in a single bound. A Soviet-born
immigrant, he was a canny, creative negotiator and a principled
leader. Sergey was restless, always pushing for more; he might drop
to the floor in the middle of a meeting for a set of push-ups.

Larry was an engineer’s engineer, the son of a computer science
pioneer. He was a soft-spoken nonconformist, a rebel with a 10x
cause: to make the internet exponentially more relevant. While



Sergey crafted the commerce of technology, Larry toiled on the
product and imagined the impossible. He was a blue-sky thinker
with his feet on the ground.

Earlier that year, when the two of them came to my office to pitch
me, their PowerPoint deck had just seventeen slides—and only two
with numbers. (They added three cartoons just to flesh out the
deck.) Though they’d made a small deal with the Washington Post,
Google had yet to unlock the value of keyword-targeted ads. As the
eighteenth search engine to arrive on the web, the company was way
late to the party. Ceding the competition such a long head start was
normally fatal, especially in technology.*

But none of that stopped Larry from lecturing me on the poor
quality of search in the market, and how much it could be improved,
and how much bigger it would be tomorrow. He and Sergey had no
doubt they would break through, never mind their lack of a business
plan. Their PageRank algorithm was that much better than the
competition, even in beta.

I asked them, “How big do you think this could be?” I’d already
made my private calculation: If everything broke right, Google
might reach a market cap of $1 billion. But I wanted to gauge their
dreams.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Google’s birthplace, the garage at 232 Santa
Margarita, Menlo Park, 1999.



And Larry responded, “Ten billion dollars.”
Just to be sure, I said, “You mean market cap, right?”
And Larry shot back, “No, I don’t mean market cap. I mean

revenue.”
I was floored. Assuming a normal growth rate for a profitable

tech firm, $10 billion in revenue would imply a $100 billion market
capitalization. That was the province of Microsoft and IBM and
Intel. That was a creature rarer than a unicorn. There was no
braggadocio to Larry, only calm, considered judgment. I didn’t
debate him; I was genuinely impressed. He and Sergey were
determined to change the world, and I believed they had a shot.

Long before Gmail or Android or Chrome, Google brimmed with
big ideas. The founders were quintessential visionaries, with
extreme entrepreneurial energy. What they lacked was management
experience.* For Google to have real impact, or even to reach liftoff,
they would have to learn to make tough choices and keep their team
on track. Given their healthy appetite for risk, they’d need to pull
the plug on losers—to fail fast.*

Not least, they would need timely, relevant data. To track their
progress. To measure what mattered.

And so: On that balmy day in Mountain View, I came with my
present for Google, a sharp-edged tool for world-class execution. I’d
first used it in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where Andy Grove,
the greatest manager of his or any era, ran the best-run company I
had ever seen. Since joining Kleiner Perkins, the Menlo Park VC
firm, I had proselytized Grove’s gospel far and wide, to fifty
companies or more.

To be clear, I have the utmost reverence for entrepreneurs. I’m
an inveterate techie who worships at the altar of innovation. But I’d
also watched too many start-ups struggle with growth and scale and
getting the right things done. So I’d come to a philosophy, my
mantra:

Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.
In the early 1980s, I took a fourteen-month sabbatical from

Kleiner to lead the desktop division at Sun Microsystems. Suddenly
I found myself in charge of hundreds of people. I was terrified. But
Andy Grove’s system was my bastion in a storm, a source of clarity
in every meeting I led. It empowered my executive team and rallied
the whole operation. Yes, we made our share of mistakes. But we
also achieved amazing things, including a new RISC microprocessor



architecture, which secured Sun’s lead in the workstation market.
That was my personal proof point for what I was bringing, all these
years later, to Google.

The practice that molded me at Intel and saved me at Sun—that
still inspires me today—is called OKRs. Short for Objectives and Key
Results. It is a collaborative goal-setting protocol for companies,
teams, and individuals. Now, OKRs are not a silver bullet. They
cannot substitute for sound judgment, strong leadership, or a
creative workplace culture. But if those fundamentals are in place,
OKRs can guide you to the mountaintop.

Larry and Sergey—with Marissa Mayer, Susan Wojcicki, Salar
Kamangar, and thirty or so others, pretty much the whole company
at the time—gathered to hear me out. They stood around the ping-
pong table (which doubled as their boardroom table), or sprawled in
beanbag chairs, dormitory style. My first PowerPoint slide defined
OKRs: “A management methodology that helps to ensure that the
company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout
the organization.”

An OBJECTIVE, I explained, is simply WHAT is to be achieved,
no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant,
concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly
designed and deployed, they’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking—
and fuzzy execution.

KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the
objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet
realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. (As prize
pupil Marissa Mayer would say, “It’s not a key result unless it has a
number.”) You either meet a key result’s requirements or you don’t;
there is no gray area, no room for doubt. At the end of the
designated period, typically a quarter, we declare the key result
fulfilled or not. Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for
a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once
they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved. (And if
it isn’t, the OKR was poorly designed in the first place.)

My objective that day, I told the band of young Googlers, was to
build a planning model for their company, as measured by three key
results:

KR #1: I would finish my presentation on time.
KR #2: We’d create a sample set of quarterly Google OKRs.



KR #3: I’d gain management agreement for a three-month OKR
trial.

By way of illustration, I sketched two OKR scenarios. The first
involved a fictional football team whose general manager cascades a
top-level objective down through the franchise org chart. The
second was a real-life drama to which I’d had a ringside seat:
Operation Crush, the campaign to restore Intel’s dominance in the
microprocessor market. (We’ll delve into both in detail later on.)

I closed by recapping a value proposition that is no less
compelling today. OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel
efforts and coordination. They link diverse operations, lending
purpose and unity to the entire organization.

I stopped talking at the ninety-minute mark, right on time. Now
it was up to Google.

—
In 2009, the Harvard Business School published a paper titled
“Goals Gone Wild.” It led with a catalog of examples of “destructive
goal pursuit”: exploding Ford Pinto fuel tanks, wholesale gouging by
Sears auto repair centers, Enron’s recklessly inflated sales targets,
the 1996 Mount Everest disaster that left eight climbers dead. Goals,
the authors cautioned, were “a prescription-strength medication
that requires careful dosing . . . and close supervision.” They even
posted a warning label: “Goals may cause systematic problems in
organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased
risk taking, decreased cooperation, and decreased motivation.” The
dark side of goal setting could swamp any benefits, or so their
argument went.

 WARNING!
Goals may cause systematic problems in

organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical
behavior, increased risk taking, decreased

cooperation, and decreased motivation.
Use care when applying goals in your organization.



The paper struck a chord and is still widely cited. Its caveat is not
without merit. Like any management system, OKRs may be
executed well or badly; the aim of this book is to help you use them
well. But make no mistake. For anyone striving for high
performance in the workplace, goals are very necessary things.

In 1968, the year Intel opened shop, a psychology professor at
the University of Maryland cast a theory that surely influenced Andy
Grove. First, said Edwin Locke, “hard goals” drive performance
more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals
“produce a higher level of output” than vaguely worded ones.

In the intervening half century, more than a thousand studies
have confirmed Locke’s discovery as “one of the most tested, and
proven, ideas in the whole of management theory.” Among
experiments in the field, 90 percent confirm that productivity is
enhanced by well-defined, challenging goals.

Year after year, Gallup surveys attest to a “worldwide employee
engagement crisis.” Less than a third of U.S. workers are “involved
in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace.”
Of those disengaged millions, more than half would leave their
company for a raise of 20 percent or less. In the technology sector,
two out of three employees think they could find a better job inside
of two months.

In business, alienation isn’t an abstract, philosophical problem; it
saps the bottom line. More highly engaged work groups generate
more profit and less attrition. According to Deloitte, the
management and leadership consulting firm, issues of “retention
and engagement have risen to No. 2 in the minds of business
leaders, second only to the challenge of building global leadership.”

But exactly how do you build engagement? A two-year Deloitte
study found that no single factor has more impact than “clearly
defined goals that are written down and shared freely. . . . Goals
create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction.”

Goal setting isn’t bulletproof: “When people have conflicting
priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they
become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated.” An effective goal
management system—an OKR system—links goals to a team’s
broader mission. It respects targets and deadlines while adapting to
circumstances. It promotes feedback and celebrates wins, large and
small. Most important, it expands our limits. It moves us to strive
for what might seem beyond our reach.



As even the “Goals Gone Wild” crowd conceded, goals “can
inspire employees and improve performance.” That, in a nutshell,
was my message for Larry and Sergey and company.

—
As I opened the floor for questions, my audience seemed intrigued. I
guessed they might give OKRs a try, though I couldn’t have foreseen
the depth of their resolve. Sergey said, “Well, we need to have some
organizing principle. We don’t have one, and this might as well be
it.” But the marriage of Google and OKRs was anything but random.
It was a great impedance match, a seamless gene transcription into
Google’s messenger RNA. OKRs were an elastic, data-driven
apparatus for a freewheeling, data-worshipping enterprise.* They
promised transparency for a team that defaulted to open—open
source, open systems, open web. They rewarded “good fails” and
daring for two of the boldest thinkers of their time.

Google, meet OKRs: a perfect fit.
—

While Larry and Sergey had few preconceptions about running a
business, they knew that writing goals down would make them
real.* They loved the notion of laying out what mattered most to
them—on one or two succinct pages—and making it public to
everyone at Google. They intuitively grasped how OKRs could keep
an organization on course through the gales of competition or the
tumult of a hockey-stick growth curve.

Along with Eric Schmidt, who two years later became Google’s
CEO, Larry and Sergey would be tenacious, insistent, even
confrontational in their use of OKRs. As Eric told author Steven
Levy, “Google’s objective is to be the systematic innovator of scale.
Innovator means new stuff. And scale means big, systematic ways of
looking at things done in a way that’s reproducible.” Together, the
triumvirate brought a decisive ingredient for OKR success:
conviction and buy-in at the top.

—
As an investor, I am long on OKRs. As Google and Intel alumni
continue to migrate and spread the good word, hundreds of
companies of all types and sizes are committing to structured goal
setting. OKRs are Swiss Army knives, suited to any environment.



We’ve seen their broadest adoption in tech, where agility and
teamwork are absolute imperatives. (In addition to the firms you
will hear from in this book, OKR adherents include AOL, Dropbox,
LinkedIn, Oracle, Slack, Spotify, and Twitter.) But the system has
also been adopted by household names far beyond Silicon Valley:
Anheuser-Busch, BMW, Disney, Exxon, Samsung. In today’s
economy, change is a fact of life. We cannot cling to what’s worked
and hope for the best. We need a trusty scythe to carve a path ahead
of the curve.

At smaller start-ups, where people absolutely need to be pulling
in the same direction, OKRs are a survival tool. In the tech sector, in
particular, young companies must grow quickly to get funding
before their capital runs dry. Structured goals give backers a
yardstick for success: We’re going to build this product, and we’ve
proven the market by talking to twenty-five customers, and here’s
how much they’re willing to pay. At medium-size, rapidly scaling
organizations, OKRs are a shared language for execution. They
clarify expectations: What do we need to get done (and fast), and
who’s working on it? They keep employees aligned, vertically and
horizontally.

In larger enterprises, OKRs are neon-lit road signs. They
demolish silos and cultivate connections among far-flung
contributors. By enabling frontline autonomy, they give rise to fresh
solutions. And they keep even the most successful organizations
stretching for more.

Similar benefits accrue in the not-for-profit world. At the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation, a $20 billion start-up, OKRs deliver the
real-time data that Bill Gates needs to wage war against malaria,
polio, and HIV. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a Gates alumna, ported the
process to the federal Office of Management and Budget and later to
the Department of Health and Human Services, where it helped the
U.S. government fight Ebola.

But perhaps no organization, not even Intel, has scaled OKRs
more effectively than Google. While conceptually simple, Andy
Grove’s regimen demands rigor, commitment, clear thinking, and
intentional communication. We’re not just making some list and
checking it twice. We’re building our capacity, our goal muscle, and
there is always some pain for meaningful gain. Yet Google’s leaders
have never faltered. Their hunger for learning and improving
remains insatiable.



As Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg observed in their book
How Google Works, OKRs became the “simple tool that
institutionalized the founders’ ‘think big’ ethos.” In Google’s early
years, Larry Page set aside two days per quarter to personally
scrutinize the OKRs for each and every software engineer. (I’d sit in
on some of those reviews, and Larry’s analytical legerdemain—his
preternatural ability to find coherence in so many moving parts—
was unforgettable.) As the company expanded, Larry continued to
kick off each quarter with a marathon debate on his leadership
team’s objectives.

Today, nearly two decades after my slide show at the ping-pong
table, OKRs remain a part of Google’s daily life. With growth and its
attendant complexity, the company’s leaders might have settled into
more bureaucratic methods or scrapped OKRs for the latest
management fad. Instead, they have stayed the course. The system
is alive and well. OKRs are the scaffolding for Google’s signature
home runs, including seven products with a billion or more users
apiece: Search, Chrome, Android, Maps, YouTube, Google Play, and
Gmail. In 2008, a company-wide OKR rallied all hands around the
Code Yellow battle against latency—Google’s bête noire, the lag in
retrieving data from the cloud. Bottom-up OKRs work hand in glove
with “20 percent time,” which frees grassroots engineers to dive into
promising side projects.

Many companies have a “rule of seven,” limiting managers to a
maximum of seven direct reports. In some cases, Google has flipped
the rule to a minimum of seven. (When Jonathan Rosenberg headed
Google’s product team, he had as many as twenty.) The higher the
ratio of reports, the flatter the org chart—which means less top-
down oversight, greater frontline autonomy, and more fertile soil
for the next breakthrough. OKRs help make all of these good things
possible.

In October 2018, for the seventy-fifth consecutive quarter,
Google’s CEO will lead the entire company to evaluate its progress
against top-level objectives and key results. In November and
December, each team and product area will develop its own plans
for the coming year and distill them into OKRs. The following
January, as CEO Sundar Pichai told me, “We’ll go back in front of
the company and articulate, ‘This is our high-level strategy, and
here are the OKRs we have written for the year.’”* (In accordance



with company tradition, the executive team will also grade Google’s
OKRs from the prior year, with failures unblinkingly dissected.)

Over the following weeks and months, thousands of Googlers will
formulate, discuss, revise, and grade their team and individual
OKRs. As always, they’ll have carte blanche to browse their intranet
and see how other teams are measuring success. They’ll be able to
trace how their work connects up, down, and sideways—how it fits
into Google’s big picture.

Not quite twenty years later, Larry’s jaw-dropping projection
now looks conservative. As we go to press, parent company
Alphabet’s market cap exceeds $700 billion, making it the second-
most valuable company in the world. In 2017, for the sixth year in a
row, Google ranked number one on Fortune magazine’s list of “Best
Companies to Work For.” This runaway success is rooted in strong
and stable leadership, a wealth of technical resources, and a values-
based culture of transparency, teamwork, and relentless innovation.
But OKRs have also played a vital role. I cannot imagine the
Googleplex running without them, and neither can Larry or Sergey.

As you will see in the pages to come, objectives and key results
drive clarity, accountability, and the uninhibited pursuit of
greatness. Take it from Eric Schmidt, who credits OKRs with
“changing the course of the company forever.”

—
For decades I’ve been the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs, doing my best
to disseminate Andy Grove’s genius with my twenty slides and
earnest proposition. But I always felt I was skating on the surface,
not really getting the job done. A few years ago, I decided it would
be worth trying again—in print this time, and in enough depth to do
the subject justice. This book—with its companion website,
whatmatters.com—is my chance to bring a long-held passion to you,
my reader. I hope you find it useful. I can tell you it has changed my
life.

I’ve introduced the OKR system to the world’s most ambitious
nonprofit and to an iconic Irish rock star. (And you’ll hear from
them directly.) I’ve witnessed countless individuals use objectives
and key results to grow more disciplined in their thinking, clearer in
communication, more purposeful in action. If this book were an
OKR, I’d call its objective aspirational: to make people’s lives, your
life, more fulfilling.



Grove was ahead of his time. Acute focus, open sharing, exacting
measurement, a license to shoot for the moon—these are the
hallmarks of modern goal science. Where OKRs take root, merit
trumps seniority. Managers become coaches, mentors, and
architects. Actions—and data—speak louder than words.

In sum, objectives and key results are a potent, proven force for
operating excellence—for Google, so why not for you?

—
Like OKRs themselves, this book comes in two complementary
sections. Part One considers the system’s cardinal features and how
it turns good ideas into superior execution and workplace
satisfaction. We begin with OKRs’ origin story at Andy Grove’s Intel,
where I became a zealous convert. Then come the four OKR
“superpowers”: focus, align, track, and stretch.

Superpower #1—Focus and Commit to Priorities (chapters 4, 5, and 6):
High-performance organizations home in on work that’s
important, and are equally clear on what doesn’t matter. OKRs
impel leaders to make hard choices. They’re a precision
communication tool for departments, teams, and individual
contributors. By dispelling confusion, OKRs give us the focus
needed to win.

Superpower #2—Align and Connect for Teamwork (chapters 7, 8, and 9):
With OKR transparency, everyone’s goals—from the CEO
down—are openly shared. Individuals link their objectives to
the company’s game plan, identify cross-dependencies, and
coordinate with other teams. By connecting each contributor
to the organization’s success, top-down alignment brings
meaning to work. By deepening people’s sense of ownership,
bottom-up OKRs foster engagement and innovation.

Superpower #3—Track for Accountability (chapters 10 and 11):
OKRs are driven by data. They are animated by periodic
check-ins, objective grading, and continuous reassessment—
all in a spirit of no-judgment accountability. An endangered
key result triggers action to get it back on track, or to revise or
replace it if warranted.



Superpower #4—Stretch for Amazing (chapters 12, 13, and 14):
OKRs motivate us to excel by doing more than we’d thought
possible. By testing our limits and affording the freedom to
fail, they release our most creative, ambitious selves.

Part Two covers OKRs’ applications and implications for the new
world of work:

CFRs (chapters 15 and 16): The failings of annual performance
reviews have sparked a robust alternative—continuous
performance management. I will introduce OKRs’ younger
sibling, CFRs (Conversation, Feedback, Recognition), and
show how OKRs and CFRs can team up to lift leaders,
contributors, and organizations to a whole new level.

Continuous Improvement (chapter 17): As a case study for structured
goal setting and continuous performance management, we see
a robotics-powered pizza company deploys OKRs in every
aspect of its operations, from the kitchen to marketing and
sales.

The Importance of Culture (chapters 18, 19, and 20): Here we’ll explore
the impact of OKRs on the workplace, and how they ease and
expedite culture change.

Along our journey, we’ll rove behind the scenes to observe OKRs
and CFRs in a dozen very different organizations, from Bono’s ONE
Campaign in Africa to YouTube and its quest for 10x growth.
Collectively these stories demonstrate the range and potential of
structured goal setting and continuous performance management,
and how they are transforming the way we work.

The Father of OKRs

There are so many people working so hard and
achieving so little.

—Andy Grove

T his all began with an ex-girlfriend I was trying to win back.
Ann had dumped me and was working in Silicon Valley, but I
didn’t know where. It was the summer of 1975, between terms

at Harvard Business School. I drove through Yosemite and arrived
in the Valley with no job and no place to live. Though my future was
unsettled, I could program computers.* While earning my master’s
in electrical engineering at Rice University, I’d cofounded a
company to write graphics software for Burroughs, one of the
“Seven Dwarfs” battling IBM for market share. I loved every minute
of it.

I’d hoped to land an internship at one of the Valley’s venture
capital firms, but they all turned me down. One suggested I try a
chip company they’d funded in Santa Clara, a place called Intel. I
cold-called the highest-ranking Intel person I could get on the
phone, Bill Davidow, who headed the microcomputer division.
When Bill heard I could write benchmarks, he invited me to come
down and meet him.

The Santa Clara headquarters was an open expanse of low-walled
cubicles, not yet a design cliché. After a brief chat, Bill referred me
to his marketing manager, Jim Lally, who referred me on down the
line. By five o’clock I’d scored a summer internship at the rising
paragon of tech firms. As luck would have it, I found my ex-
girlfriend there, too, working just down the corridor. She was not



amused when I showed up. (But by Labor Day, Ann and I would be
back together.)

Midway through orientation, Bill took me aside and said, “John,
let’s be clear about something. There’s one guy running operations
here, and that’s Andy Grove.” Grove’s title was executive vice
president; he would wait twelve more years to succeed Gordon
Moore as CEO. But Andy was Intel’s communicator, its operator par
excellence, its taskmaster-in-chief. Everybody knew he was in
charge.

By pedigree, Grove was the least likely member of the Intel
Trinity that ran the company for three decades. Gordon Moore was
the shy and revered deep thinker, author of the eponymous law that
underpins the exponential scaling of technology: Computer
processing power doubles every two years. Robert Noyce, co-
inventor of the integrated circuit (aka the microchip), was the
charismatic Mr. Outside, the industry’s ambassador, equally at
home at a congressional hearing or buying a round of drinks at the
Wagon Wheel. (The semiconductor crowd was a hard-partying
crowd.)

And then there was András István Gróf, a Hungarian refugee
who’d narrowly escaped the Nazis and reached the U.S. at age
twenty with no money, little English, and severe hearing loss. He
was a coiled and compact man with curly hair and a maniacal drive.
By dint of sheer will and brainpower, he rose to the top of the most
admired organization in Silicon Valley and led it to phenomenal
success. During Grove’s eleven-year tenure as CEO, Intel would
return more than 40 percent per annum to its shareholders, on a
par with the arc of Moore’s law.



Andy Grove, 1983.

Intel was Grove’s laboratory for management innovation. He
loved to teach, and the company reaped the benefits.* A few days
after getting hired, I received a coveted invitation to Intel’s
Organization, Philosophy, and Economics course, known as iOPEC,
a seminar on Intel strategy and operations. Resident professor: Dr.
Andy Grove.

In the space of an hour, Grove traced the company’s history, year
by year. He summarized Intel’s core pursuits: a profit margin twice
the industry norm, market leadership in any product line it entered,
the creation of “challenging jobs” and “growth opportunities” for
employees.* Fair enough, I thought, though I’d heard similar things
at business school.

Then he said something that left a lasting impression on me. He
referenced his previous company, Fairchild, where he’d first met
Noyce and Moore and went on to blaze a trail in silicon wafer
research. Fairchild was the industry’s gold standard, but it had one
great flaw: a lack of “achievement orientation.”

“Expertise was very much valued there,” Andy explained. “That is
why people got hired. That’s why people got promoted. Their
effectiveness at translating that knowledge into actual results was
kind of shrugged off.” At Intel, he went on, “we tend to be exactly
the opposite. It almost doesn’t matter what you know. It’s what you



can do with whatever you know or can acquire and actually
accomplish [that] tends to be valued here.” Hence the company’s
slogan: “Intel delivers.”

It almost doesn’t matter what you know. . . . To claim that
knowledge was secondary and execution all-important—well, I
wouldn’t learn that at Harvard. I found the proposition thrilling, a
real-world affirmation of accomplishment over credentials. But
Grove wasn’t finished, and he had saved the best for last. Over a few
closing minutes, he outlined a system he’d begun to install in 1971,
when Intel was three years old. It was my first exposure to the art of
formal goal setting. I was mesmerized.

A few unvarnished excerpts, straight from the father of OKRs:*

Now, the two key phrases . . . are objectives and the key result.
And they match the two purposes. The objective is the
direction: “We want to dominate the mid-range
microcomputer component business.” That’s an objective.
That’s where we’re going to go. Key results for this quarter:
“Win ten new designs for the 8085” is one key result. It’s a
milestone. The two are not the same. . . .

The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can
look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do
it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.

Now, did we dominate the mid-range microcomputer
business? That’s for us to argue in the years to come, but over
the next quarter we’ll know whether we’ve won ten new
designs or not.

It was a “very, very simple system,” Grove said, knowing
simplicity was catnip to an audience of engineers. On its face, the
conception seemed logical, commonsensical—and inspiring. Against
the stale management orthodoxy of the period, Grove had created
something fresh and original. Strictly speaking, however, his
“objectives and key results” did not spring from the void. The
process had a precursor. In finding his way, Grove had followed the
trail of a legendary, Vienna-born gadfly, the first great “modern”
business management thinker: Peter Drucker.



Our MBO Ancestors

The early-twentieth-century forefathers of management theory,
notably Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford, were the first to
measure output systematically and analyze how to get more of it.
They held that the most efficient and profitable organization was
authoritarian.* Scientific management, Taylor wrote, consists of
“knowing exactly what you want men to do and then see that they
do it in the best and cheapest way.” The results, as Grove noted,
were “crisp and hierarchical: there were those who gave orders and
those who took orders and executed them without question.”

Half a century later, Peter Drucker—professor, journalist,
historian—took a wrecking ball to the Taylor-Ford model. He
conceived a new management ideal, results-driven yet humanistic.
A corporation, he wrote, should be a community “built on trust and
respect for the workers—not just a profit machine.” Further, he
urged that subordinates be consulted on company goals. Instead of
traditional crisis management, he proposed a balance of long- and
short-range planning, informed by data and enriched by regular
conversations among colleagues.

Drucker aimed to map out “a principle of management that will
give full scope to individual strength and responsibility and at the
same time give common direction of vision and effort, establish
team work and harmonize the goals of the individual with the
common weal.” He discerned a basic truth of human nature: When
people help choose a course of action, they are more likely to see it
through. In 1954, in his landmark book The Practice of
Management, Drucker codified this principle as “management by
objectives and self-control.” It became Andy Grove’s foundation and
the genesis of what we now call the OKR.

By the 1960s, management by objectives—or MBOs, as the
process was known—had been adopted by a number of forward-
thinking companies. The most prominent was Hewlett-Packard,
where it was a part of the celebrated “H-P Way.” As these businesses
trained their attention on a handful of top priorities, the results
were impressive. In a meta-analysis of seventy studies, high
commitment to MBOs led to productivity gains of 56 percent, versus
6 percent where commitment was low.



Eventually, though, the limitations of MBOs caught up with
them. At many companies, goals were centrally planned and
sluggishly trickled down the hierarchy. At others, they became
stagnant for lack of frequent updating; or trapped and obscured in
silos; or reduced to key performance indicators (KPIs), numbers
without soul or context. Most deadly of all, MBOs were commonly
tied to salaries and bonuses. If risk taking might be penalized, why
chance it? By the 1990s, the system was falling from vogue. Even
Drucker soured on it. MBOs, he said, were “just another tool” and
“not the great cure for management inefficiency.”

Measuring Output

Andy Grove’s quantum leap was to apply manufacturing production
principles to the “soft professions,” the administrative, professional,
and managerial ranks. He sought to “create an environment that
values and emphasizes output” and to avoid what Drucker termed
the “activity trap”: “[S]tressing output is the key to increasing
productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the
opposite.” On an assembly line, it’s easy enough to distinguish
output from activity. It gets trickier when employees are paid to
think. Grove wrestled with two riddles: How can we define and
measure output by knowledge workers? And what can be done to
increase it?

Grove was a scientific manager. He read everything in the
budding fields of behavioral science and cognitive psychology.
While the latest theories offered “a nicer way to get people to work”
than in Henry Ford’s heyday, controlled university experiments
“simply would not show that one style of leadership was better than
another. It was hard to escape the conclusion that no optimal
management style existed.” At Intel, Andy recruited “aggressive
introverts” in his own image, people who solved problems quickly,
objectively, systematically, and permanently. Following his lead,
they were skilled at confronting a problem without attacking the
person. They set politics aside to make faster, sounder, more
collective decisions.

Intel relied on systems in every facet of its operations. Marking
his debt to Drucker, Grove named his goal-setting system “iMBOs,”



for Intel Management by Objectives. In practice, however, it was
very different from the classical MBO. Grove rarely mentioned
objectives without tying them to “key results,” a term he seems to
have coined himself. To avoid confusion, I’ll refer to his approach as
“OKRs,” the acronym I assembled from the master’s lexicon. In
nearly every respect, the new method negated the old:

MBOs vs. OKRs

MBOs Intel OKRs
“What” “What” and “How”
Annual Quarterly or Monthly
Private and Siloed Public and Transparent
Top-down Bottom-up or Sideways (~50%)
Tied to Compensation Mostly Divorced from Compensation
Risk Averse Aggressive and Aspirational

By 1975, when I arrived at Intel, Grove’s OKR system was in full
swing. Every knowledge worker in the company formulated monthly
individual objectives and key results. Within days of the iOPEC
seminar, my supervisor directed me to do the same. I’d been put to
work writing benchmarks for the 8080, Intel’s latest entry in the 8-
bit microprocessor marketplace, where it reigned supreme. My goal
was to show how our chip was faster and generally beat the
competition.

My Intel OKRs are mostly lost to the pre-cloud sands of time, but
I’ll never forget the gist of my first one:

OBJECTIVE
Demonstrate the 8080’s superior performance as

compared to the Motorola 6800.

KEY RESULTS
(AS MEASURED BY . . .)

1. Deliver five benchmarks.
2. Develop a demo.
3. Develop sales training materials for the field force.
4. Call on three customers to prove the material works.



Intel’s Lifeblood

I remember typing out that OKR on an IBM Selectric. (The first
commercial laser printer was a year away.) Then I posted a hard
copy on my carrel for people to scan as they walked by. I’d never
worked at a place where you wrote down your goals, much less
where you could see everybody else’s, on up to the CEO. I found it
illuminating, a beacon of focus. And it was liberating, too. When
people came to me mid-quarter with requests to draft new data
sheets, I felt I could say no without fear of repercussion. My OKRs
backed me. They spelled out my priorities for all to see.

Through the Andy Grove era, OKRs were Intel’s lifeblood. They
stood front and center at weekly one-on-ones, biweekly staff
meetings, monthly and quarterly divisional reviews. That was how
Intel managed tens of thousands of people to etch a million lines of
silicon or copper to within a millionth of a meter in accuracy.
Fabricating semiconductors is a tough business. Without rigor,
nothing works; yields plummet, chips fail. OKRs were constant
reminders of what our teams needed to be doing. They told us
precisely what we were achieving—or not.

Along with writing my benchmarks, I trained Intel’s domestic
sales team. Weeks passed. Grove got wind that the most
knowledgeable person on the 8080 was a twenty-four-year-old
intern. One day he grabbed me and said, “Doerr, come to Europe
with me.” For a summer kid, it was a heady invitation. I joined
Grove and his wife, Eva, on a trip to Paris, London, and Munich. We
trained the European sales force, called on three big prospects, and
won two accounts. I contributed what I could. We dined at
Michelin-starred restaurants, where Grove knew his way around a
wine list. He took a liking to me; I felt awed in his presence. He was
a man who lived life large.

Back in California, Andy had Bill Davidow write a letter to
confirm I’d have a job waiting the following year. That summer was
an eye-opening, mind-blowing education, to the point where I
almost dropped out of Harvard. I figured I could learn more about
business by remaining at Intel. I compromised by returning to
Massachusetts and working part time on the company’s account
with Digital Equipment Corporation, helping to drag them kicking
and screaming into the microprocessor era. I finished my last



semester, raced back to Santa Clara, and stayed at Intel for the next
four years.

Andy Grove, OKR Incarnate

The mid-1970s marked the birth of the personal computer industry,
a yeasty time for fresh ideas and upstart entrepreneurs. I was low on
the totem pole, a first-year product manager, but Grove and I had a
relationship. One spring day I grabbed him and drove up to the first
West Coast Computer Faire at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium.
We found a former Intel executive demonstrating the Apple II, the
state of the art for graphical display. I said, “Andy, we’ve already got
the operating system. We make the microchip. We’ve got the
compilers; we’ve licensed BASIC. Intel should make a personal
computer.” But as we hiked down the aisles, past vendors hawking
plastic bags of chips and parts, Grove took a long look and said, “Eh,
these are hobbyists. We’re not going into that business.” My big
dream was dashed. Intel never did enter the PC market.

Though he wasn’t demonstrative, Grove could be a
compassionate leader. When he saw a manager failing, he would try
to find another role—perhaps at a lower level—where the person
might succeed and regain some standing and respect. Andy was a
problem solver at heart. As one Intel historian observed, he “seemed
to know exactly what he wanted and how he was going to achieve
it.”* He was sort of a walking OKR.

Intel was born in the era of the Free Speech Movement at
Berkeley and the flower children of Haight-Ashbury. Punctuality
was out of fashion among the young, even young engineers, and the
company found it challenging to get new hires into work on time.
Grove’s solution was to post a sign-in sheet at the front desk, to log
anyone dragging in after 8:05—we called it Andy’s Late List. Grove
collected the sheet each morning at 9:00 sharp. (On those mornings
when I was tardy, I’d try to beat the system by sitting in the parking
lot until five minutes after nine.) Nobody knew of anyone who’d
been docked. Even so, the list signified the importance of self-
discipline in a business with no margin for error.

Grove was hard on everybody, most of all himself. A proudly self-
made man, he could be arrogant. He did not suffer fools, or



meandering meetings, or ill-formed proposals. (He kept a set of
rubber stamps on his desk, including one engraved BULLSHIT.) The
best way to solve a management problem, he believed, was through
“creative confrontation”—by facing people “bluntly, directly, and
unapologetically.”*

Despite Andy’s hot temper, he was down-to-earth and
approachable, open to any good idea. As he once told The New York
Times, Intel managers “leave our stripes outside when we go into a
meeting.” Every big decision, he believed, should begin with a “free
discussion stage . . . an inherently egalitarian process.” The way to
get his respect was to disagree and stand your ground and, ideally,
be shown to be right in the end.

After I’d logged eighteen months as a product manager, Jim Lally
—by then the head of systems marketing, and a great mentor and
hero of mine—said to me, “Doerr, if you want to be a really good
general manager someday, you need to get out in the field, sell, get
rejected, and learn to meet a quota. You can have all the technical
expertise in the world, but you’ll succeed or fail in this business
based on whether your team makes their numbers.”

I chose Chicago. In 1978, after Ann and I got married, I became a
technical sales rep in the Midwest region. It was the best job I’ve
ever had. I loved helping our customers make a better dialysis
machine or traffic-light controller. I loved selling Intel
microprocessors, the brains of the computer, and I was pretty good
at it. (I came by this talent honestly; my father, Lou Doerr, was a
mechanical engineer who loved people and loved selling to them.)
Since I’d written all the benchmarks, I knew the programming cold.
My sales quota that first year was an intimidating $1 million, but I
beat it.

After Chicago, I returned to Santa Clara as a marketing manager.
Suddenly I had to hire a small team, guide my people’s work, and
measure it against expectations. My skill set was stretched, and
that’s when I came to more fully appreciate Grove’s goal-setting
system. With an Intel manager coaching me through the process, I
developed more discipline, more constancy. I relied on OKRs to
communicate more clearly and help my team get our most
important work done. None of this came naturally. It was a second,
deeper level of learning objectives and key results.

In 1980, an opportunity surfaced at Kleiner Perkins to leverage
my technical background in working with new companies. Andy



could not fathom why I would want to leave Intel. (He himself put
the company ahead of everything, with the possible exception of his
grandchildren.) He had an amazing ability to reach into your chest
and grab your heart, pull it out, and hold it in his hands in front of
you. By then he was the company’s president, and he said, “Come
on, Doerr, don’t you want to be a general manager and own a real
P&L? I’ll let you run Intel’s software division.” It was a nonexistent
business, but could have been built into one. Then he added a
zinger: “John, venture capital, that’s not a real job. It’s like being a
real estate agent.”

Andy Grove’s Legacy

When Grove died at seventy-nine after years of stoic suffering with
Parkinson’s disease, The New York Times called him “one of the
most acclaimed and influential personalities of the computer and
Internet era.” He wasn’t an immortal theorist like Gordon Moore or
an iconic public figure like Bob Noyce. Nor did he publish enough to
rest beside Peter Drucker in the pantheon of management
philosophy. Yet Grove changed the way we live. In 1997, three
decades after his experiments at Fairchild, he was named Time
magazine’s Man of the Year, “the person most responsible for the
amazing growth in the power and the innovative potential of
microchips.” Andy Grove was a rare hybrid, a supreme technologist
and the greatest chief executive of his day. We sorely miss him.

Dr. Grove’s Basic OKR Hygiene
The essence of a healthy OKR culture—ruthless intellectual honesty, a
disregard for self-interest, deep allegiance to the team—flowed from the fiber
of Andy Grove’s being. But it was Grove’s nuts-and-bolts approach, his
engineer’s mentality, that made the system work. OKRs are his legacy, his
most valuable and lasting management practice. Here are some lessons I
learned at Intel from the master and from Jim Lally, Andy’s OKR disciple and
my mentor:

Less is more. “A few extremely well-chosen objectives,” Grove wrote,
“impart a clear message about what we say ‘yes’ to and what we say ‘no’ to.”
A limit of three to five OKRs per cycle leads companies, teams, and individuals
to choose what matters most. In general, each objective should be tied to five
or fewer key results. (See chapter 4, “Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to
Priorities.”)



Set goals from the bottom up. To promote engagement, teams and
individuals should be encouraged to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in
consultation with managers. When all goals are set top-down, motivation is
corroded. (See chapter 7, “Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.”)

No dictating. OKRs are a cooperative social contract to establish priorities
and define how progress will be measured. Even after company objectives are
closed to debate, their key results continue to be negotiated. Collective
agreement is essential to maximum goal achievement. (See chapter 7,
“Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.”)

Stay flexible. If the climate has changed and an objective no longer seems
practical or relevant as written, key results can be modified or even discarded
mid-cycle. (See chapter 10, “Superpower #3: Track for Accountability.”)

Dare to fail. “Output will tend to be greater,” Grove wrote, “when everybody
strives for a level of achievement beyond [their] immediate grasp. . . . Such
goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from
yourself and your subordinates.” While certain operational objectives must be
met in full, aspirational OKRs should be uncomfortable and possibly
unattainable. “Stretched goals,” as Grove called them, push organizations to
new heights. (See chapter 12, “Superpower #4: Stretch for Amazing.”)

A tool, not a weapon. The OKR system, Grove wrote, “is meant to pace a
person—to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own
performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance
review.” To encourage risk taking and prevent sandbagging, OKRs and
bonuses are best kept separate. (See chapter 15, “Continuous Performance
Management: OKRs and CFRs.”)

Be patient; be resolute. Every process requires trial and error. As Grove
told his iOPEC students, Intel “stumbled a lot of times” after adopting OKRs:
“We didn’t fully understand the principal purpose of it. And we are kind of doing
better with it as time goes on.” An organization may need up to four or five
quarterly cycles to fully embrace the system, and even more than that to build
mature goal muscle.

Operation Crush: An Intel Story

Bill Davidow
Former Vice President, Microcomputer Systems Division

O peration Crush—the fight for survival by a young Intel
Corporation—is the subject of our first extended story on
OKRs. Crush illustrates all four OKR superpowers: focus,

alignment, tracking, and stretching. Most of all, it shows how this
goal-setting system can move multiple departments and thousands
of individuals toward a common objective.

Near the end of my time at Intel, the company faced an
existential threat. Led by Andy Grove, top management rebooted
the company’s priorities in four weeks. OKRs allowed Intel to
execute its battle plan with clarity, precision, and lightning speed.
The entire workforce shifted gears to focus together on one
prodigious goal.

Back in 1971, the Intel engineer Ted Hoff invented the original
microprocessor, the multipurpose “computer-on-a-chip.” In 1975,
Bill Gates and Paul Allen programmed the third-generation Intel
8080 and launched the personal computer revolution. By 1978,
Intel had developed the first high-performance, 16-bit
microprocessor, the 8086, which found a ready market. But soon it
was getting beaten to a pulp by two chips that were faster and easier
to program, Motorola’s 68000 and upstart Zilog’s Z8000.

In late November 1979, a district sales manager named Don
Buckout shot off a desperate eight-page telex. Buckout’s boss, Casey
Powell, sent it on to Andy Grove, then Intel’s president and chief
operating officer. The communiqué set off a five-alarm fire—and a
corporate crusade. Within a week, the executive staff had met to
confront the bad news. One week after that, a blue-ribbon task force



convened to map out Intel’s counteroffensive. Zilog, all agreed,
wasn’t a serious threat. But Motorola, an industry Goliath and
international brand, posed a clear and present danger. Jim Lally set
the tone for the war to come:

There’s only one company competing with us, and that’s Motorola. The
68000 is the competition. We have to kill Motorola, that’s the name of
the game. We have to crush the f—king bastards. We’re gonna roll over
Motorola and make sure they don’t come back again.

That became the rallying cry for Operation Crush,* the campaign
to restore Intel to its rightful place as market leader. By January
1980, armed with Andy Grove videos to exhort the troops, Crush
teams were dispatched to field offices around the globe. By the
second quarter, Intel’s salespeople had fully deployed the new
strategy. By the third quarter, they were on their way toward
meeting one of the most daring objectives in the history of tech: two
thousand “design wins,” the crucial agreements for clients to put the
8086 in their appliances and devices. By the end of that calendar
year, they’d routed the enemy and won a resounding victory.

Not one Intel product was modified for Crush. But Grove and his
executive team altered the terms of engagement. They revamped
their marketing to play to the company’s strengths. They steered
their customers to see the value of long-term systems and services
versus short-term ease of use. They stopped selling to programmers
and started selling to CEOs.

Grove “volunteered” Bill Davidow, head of Intel’s microcomputer
systems division, to lead the operation. Over his long career as an
engineer, industry executive, marketing maven, venture investor,
thinker, and author, Bill has made many lasting contributions. But
one is especially dear to my heart. Bill grafted the critical connective
tissue—the phrase “as measured by,” or a.m.b.—into Intel’s
company OKRs. For example, “We will achieve a certain
OBJECTIVE as measured by the following KEY RESULTS. . . .”
Bill’s a.m.b made the implicit explicit to all.

At a 2013 panel discussion hosted by the Computer History
Museum, Crush veterans recalled the importance of structured goal
setting at Intel—and how objectives and key results were used
“down into the trenches.” The OKRs for Operation Crush, which are
sampled here, were classics of the genre: time bound and



unambiguous, with every what and how in place. Best of all, they
worked.

As Jim Lally told me: “I was a skeptic on objectives and key
results until Grove sat down with me and explained why they
mattered. If you tell everybody to go to the center of Europe, and
some start marching off to France, and some to Germany, and some
to Italy, that’s no good—not if you want them all going to
Switzerland. If the vectors point in different directions, they add up
to zero. But if you get everybody pointing in the same direction, you
maximize the results. That was the pitch Grove gave me—and then
he told me I had to teach it.”

As Bill Davidow recounts here, OKRs were Grove’s secret weapon
in Operation Crush. They turbocharged a large and multifaceted
organization, then propelled it with surprising agility. Up against a
unified, goal-driven Intel, Motorola never stood a chance.

—
Bill Davidow: The key result system was Andy Grove’s way to mold behavior.
Andy had a single-minded commitment to making Intel great. He discouraged
people from serving on outside boards; Intel was supposed to be your life. Your
objectives and key results consolidated that commitment.

When you’re really high up in management, you’re teaching—that’s what
Andy did. Objectives and key results were embedded in the management
system at Intel, but they were also a philosophy, a seminal teaching system. We
were all taught that if you measured it, things got better.

We wrote our top-level goals with Andy in our executive staff meetings. We
sat around the table and decided: “This is it.” As a division manager, I adopted
any relevant company key results as my objectives. I brought them to my
executive team, and we’d spend the next week talking about what we would do
that quarter.

What made the system so strong is that Andy would say, “This is what the
corporation is going to do,” and everybody would go all out to support the effort.
We were part of a winning team, and we wanted to keep winning.

At lower levels, people’s objectives and key results might encompass close
to a hundred percent of their work output. But managers had additional day-to-
day responsibilities. If my objective is to grow a beautiful rose bush, I know
without asking that you also want me to keep the lawn green. I doubt I ever had
a key result that said, “Walk around to stay on top of employees’ morale.” We
wrote down the things that needed special emphasis.



Andy Grove and Bill Davidow, Intel headquarters, 1980.

Intel’s Urgency
In December 1979, I went into Andy Grove’s executive staff meeting full of
complaints. I thought the microprocessor people could do a better job of racking
up design wins for the 8086. I wanted to goad them into fighting back and
believing in themselves again. And then Andy tagged me and told me to “solve
the problem.” Operation Crush became my job.

The 8086 didn’t bring in so much revenue in and of itself, but it had a broad
ripple effect. My division sold design aids—software development systems—for
systems using Intel microprocessors. Though we were growing like crazy, we
were still dependent on customers’ choosing Intel’s microchip for their products.
Once Intel got its foot in the door with the 8086, we’d get EPROM [the
programmable, read-only-memory chip invented at Intel in 1971] and peripheral
and controller chip contracts as well. In total, they might be worth ten times the
original sale. But if the 8086 went away, my systems business went away, too.

So the stakes were high. After making its reputation as a supplier of memory
chips, Intel was under siege. Recently we’d lost the lead on DRAM [the most
widely used and economical type of computer memory] to a start-up, and
couldn’t seem to regain our momentum. Japanese companies were spoiling to
invade our beachhead in the lucrative market for EPROM. Microprocessors



were Intel’s best hope for the future, and we had to get back on top. I can still
remember the first slide of one early presentation:

Crush, the purpose: To establish a sense of urgency and set in motion
critical, corporate-wide decisions and action plans to address a life-threatening
competitive challenge.

Our task force convened on Tuesday, December 4. We met for three days
running, many hours a day. It was an intellectual challenge, like solving an
enormous puzzle. There was no time to rebuild the 8086, so we spent most of
our time figuring out just what we had to sell and how to regain a competitive
advantage over Motorola.

I thought we could win by creating a new narrative. We needed to convince
our customers that the microprocessor they chose today would be their most
important decision for the next decade. Sure, Motorola could come in and say,
“We’ve got a cleaner instruction set.” But they couldn’t match our broad product
family or system-level performance. They couldn’t compete with our superb
technical support or low cost of ownership. With Intel peripherals, we’d remind
people, your products get to market faster and cheaper. With Intel design aids,
your engineers work more efficiently.

Motorola was a big, diverse company that made everything from two-way
radios to pocket televisions. Intel was a technology leader that stuck to memory
chips and microprocessors and systems that supported them. Who would you
rather call when something went wrong? Who would you count on to stay in the
vanguard?

We had a lot of good ideas that needed to be woven together. Jim Lally
wrote them on the whiteboard: “Publish a future products catalog”; “Develop a
sales pitch for fifty seminars—and attendees get a catalog.” By Friday, we had a
plan to mobilize the company. By the following Tuesday, we had approval for a
nine-part program—including a multimillion-dollar ad spend, something Intel had
never done before. Within a week after that, the strategy went out to the sales
force, which was eager to sign on. They’d alerted us to the crisis in the first
place, after all.

All that happened before Christmas.
Motorola was extremely well run, but it had a different sense of urgency.

When Casey Powell smacked us between the eyes, we responded within two
weeks. When we smacked Motorola between the eyes, they couldn’t move
nearly so fast. A manager there told me, “I couldn’t get a plane ticket from
Chicago to Arizona approved in the time you took to launch your campaign.”

Intel excelled at declaring great generalizations and translating them into
actionable, coordinated programs. Each of our nine projects became a
company key result. Here’s an Intel Crush corporate OKR and a related
engineering OKR from the second quarter of 1980:

INTEL CORPORATE OBJECTIVE

Turning on a Dime
Early on, just after the first of the year, Bob Noyce and Andy Grove staged a
Crush kickoff at the San Jose Hyatt House. Their directive to Intel’s
management corps was simple and clear: “We’re going to win in 16-bit
microprocessors. We’re committed to this.” Andy told us what we had to do and
why we had to do it, and that we should consider it a priority until it was done.

There were close to one hundred people at the meeting. The message
penetrated two levels of management off the bat, and to a third level within
twenty-four hours. Word spread awfully fast. Intel was close to a billion-dollar
company at the time, and it turned on a dime. To this day, I have never seen
anything like it.

And it couldn’t have happened without the key result system. If Andy had run
the San Jose meeting without it, how could he have simultaneously kicked off
all those Crush activities? I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen people walk
out of meetings saying, “I’m going to conquer the world” . . . and three months
later, nothing has happened. You get people whipped up with enthusiasm, but
they don’t know what to do with it. In a crisis, you need a system that can drive
transformation—quickly. That’s what the key result system did for Intel. It gave



management a tool for rapid implementation. And when people reported on
what they’d gotten done, we had black-and-white criteria for assessment.

Andy Grove marshals the troops for Operation Crush, January 1980.

Crush was a thoroughly cascaded set of OKRs, heavily driven from the top,
but with input from below. At Andy Grove’s level, or even my level, you couldn’t
know all the mechanics of how the battle should be won. A lot of this stuff has to
flow uphill. You can tell people to clean up a mess, but should you be telling
them which broom to use? When top management was saying “We’ve got to
crush Motorola!” somebody at the bottom might have said “Our benchmarks are
lousy; I think I’ll write some better benchmarks.” That was how we worked.

The Greater Good
Intel stayed on a war footing for six months. I was in a staff position, with no line
authority, but I got whatever I needed because the whole company knew how
much it mattered to Andy. When the key results came back from Intel’s
divisions, there was virtually no dissent. Everybody was on board. We
redirected resources on the fly; I don’t think I even had a budget.

Operation Crush ultimately included top management, the entire sales force,
four different marketing departments, and three geographic locations—all



pulling together as one.* What made Intel different was that it was so apolitical.
Managers sacrificed their little fiefdoms for the greater good. Say the
microprocessors division was putting out the futures catalog. Somebody might
notice, “Oh my God, we’ve got a peripheral missing”—and that would ripple out
to the peripherals division and the allocation of engineering resources. The
sales force organized the seminars, but they leaned on application engineers
and marketing, and on my division, too. Corporate communications wrangled
articles for the trade press from all over the company. It was a total
organizational effort.

When I think about Crush, I still can’t believe we pulled it off. I guess the
lesson is that culture counts. Andy always wanted people to bring problems to
management’s attention. A field engineer tells his general manager, “You
turkeys don’t understand what’s happening in the market,” and within two
weeks, the whole company is realigned, top to bottom. Everyone’s agreed: “The
whistleblower is right. We’ve got to act differently.” It was terribly important that
Don Buckout and Casey Powell felt they could speak their minds without
retribution. Without that, there’s no Operation Crush.

—
Andy Grove was accustomed to having the last word, so let’s give it
to him here. “Bad companies,” Andy wrote, “are destroyed by crisis.
Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by
them.” So it was for Operation Crush. By 1986, when Intel dumped
its formative memory-chip business to go all-in on microprocessors,
the 8086 had recaptured 85 percent of the 16-bit market. A bargain-
priced variant, the 8088, found fame and fortune inside the first
IBM PC, which would standardize the personal computer platform.
Today, tens of billions of microcontrollers—in computers and cars,
smart thermostats and blood-bank centrifuges—all run on Intel
architecture.

And as we’ve seen, none of this would have happened without
OKRs.

Superpower #1: Focus and Commit
to Priorities

It is our choices . . . that show what we truly are, far
more than our abilities.

—J. K. Rowling

M easuring what matters begins with the question: What is
most important for the next three (or six, or twelve)
months? Successful organizations focus on the handful of

initiatives that can make a real difference, deferring less urgent
ones. Their leaders commit to those choices in word and deed. By
standing firmly behind a few top-line OKRs, they give their teams a
compass and a baseline for assessment. (Wrong decisions can be
corrected once results begin to roll in. Nondecisions—or hastily
abandoned ones—teach us nothing.) What are our main priorities
for the coming period? Where should people concentrate their
efforts? An effective goal-setting system starts with disciplined
thinking at the top, with leaders who invest the time and energy to
choose what counts.

While paring back a list of goals is invariably a challenge, it is
well worth the effort. As any seasoned leader will tell you, no one
individual—or company—can “do it all.” With a select set of OKRs,
we can highlight a few things—the vital things—that must get done,
as planned and on time.

In the Beginning . . .



For organization-level OKRs, the buck stops with senior leadership.
They must personally commit to the process.

Where do they begin? How do they decide what truly matters
most? Google turned to its mission statement: Organize the world’s
information and make it universally accessible and useful.
Android, Google Earth, Chrome, the new-and-improved YouTube
search engine—these products and dozens more share a common
lineage. In each case, the impetus for development came from the
founders and executive team, who made plain their focus and
commitment through objectives and key results.

But good ideas aren’t bound by hierarchy. The most powerful and
energizing OKRs often originate with frontline contributors. As a
YouTube product manager, Rick Klau was responsible for the site’s
homepage, the third most visited in the world. The hitch: Only a
small fraction of users logged in to the site. They were missing out
on important features, from saving videos to channel subscriptions.
Much of YouTube’s value was effectively hidden to hundreds of
millions of people around the world. Meanwhile, the company was
forfeiting priceless data. To solve the problem, Rick’s team devised a
six-month OKR to improve the site’s login experience. They made
their case to YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar, who consulted with
Google CEO Larry Page. Larry opted to elevate the login objective to
a Google company-wide OKR, but with a caveat: The deadline
would be three months, not six.

When an OKR rises to the top line, “all eyes in the company are
on your team,” Rick says. “That’s a lot of eyes! We had no idea how
we’d do it in three months, but we understood that owning a
company-level OKR showed that our work took priority.” By adding
so much emphasis to a product manager’s goal, Larry clarified
things for other teams, too. As in Operation Crush, everyone rallied
to help Rick’s group succeed. The YouTube cadre finished on time,
though they shipped one week late.

Regardless of how leaders choose a company’s top-line goals,
they also need goals of their own. Just as values cannot be
transmitted by memo,* structured goal setting won’t take root by
fiat. As you’ll see in chapter 6, Nuna’s Jini Kim discovered the hard
way that OKRs require a public commitment by leadership, in word
and deed. When I hear CEOs say “All my goals are team goals,” it’s a
red flag. Talking a good OKR game is not enough. To quote the late,
great Bill Campbell, the Intuit CEO who later coached the Google



executive team: “When you’re the CEO or the founder of a
company . . . you’ve got to say ‘This is what we’re doing,’ and then
you have to model it. Because if you don’t model it, no one’s going to
do it.”

Communicate with Clarity

For sound decision making, esprit de corps, and superior
performance, top-line goals must be clearly understood throughout
the organization. Yet by their own admission, two of three
companies fail to communicate these goals consistently. In a survey
of eleven thousand senior executives and managers, a majority
couldn’t name their company’s top priorities. Only half could name
even one.

Leaders must get across the why as well as the what. Their
people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting
for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission.
And the process can’t stop with unveiling top-line OKRs at a
quarterly all-hands meeting. As LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner likes to
say, “When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear it.”

Key Results: Care and Feeding

Objectives and key results are the yin and yang of goal setting—
principle and practice, vision and execution. Objectives are the stuff
of inspiration and far horizons. Key results are more earthbound
and metric-driven. They typically include hard numbers for one or
more gauges: revenue, growth, active users, quality, safety, market
share, customer engagement. To make reliable progress, as Peter
Drucker noted, a manager “must be able to measure . . .
performance and results against the goal.”

In other words: Key results are the levers you pull, the marks you
hit to achieve the goal. If an objective is well framed, three to five
KRs will usually be adequate to reach it. Too many can dilute focus
and obscure progress. Besides, each key result should be a challenge



in its own right. If you’re certain you’re going to nail it, you’re
probably not pushing hard enough.

What, How, When

Since OKRs are a shock to the established order, it may make sense
to ease into them. Some companies begin with an annual cycle as
they transition from private to public goal setting, or from a top-
down process to a more collaborative one. The best practice may be
a parallel, dual cadence, with short-horizon OKRs (for the here and
now) supporting annual OKRs and longer-term strategies. Keep in
mind, though, that it’s the shorter-term goals that drive the actual
work. They keep annual plans honest—and executed.

Clear-cut time frames intensify our focus and commitment;
nothing moves us forward like a deadline. To win in the global
marketplace, organizations need to be more nimble than ever
before. In my experience, a quarterly OKR cadence is best suited to
keep pace with today’s fast-changing markets. A three-month
horizon curbs procrastination and leads to real performance gains.
In High Output Management, his leadership bible, Andy Grove
notes:

For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the
activity it is measuring occurs. Accordingly, an [OKR] system should set
objectives for a relatively short period. For example, if we plan on a yearly
basis, the corresponding [OKR] time should be at least as often as
quarterly or perhaps even monthly.

There is no religion to this protocol, no one-size-fits-all. An
engineering team might opt for six-week OKR cycles to stay in sync
with development sprints. A monthly cycle could do the trick for an
early-stage company still finding its product-market fit. The best
OKR cadence is the one that fits the context and culture of your
business.

Pairing Key Results



The history of the infamous Ford Pinto shows the hazards of one-
dimensional OKRs. In 1971, after bleeding market share to more
fuel-efficient models from Japan and Germany, Ford countered
with the Pinto, a budget-priced subcompact. To meet CEO Lee
Iacocca’s aggressive demands, product managers skipped over
safety checks in planning and development. For example: The new
model’s gas tank was placed six inches in front of a flimsy rear
bumper.

The Pinto was a firetrap, and Ford’s engineers knew it. But the
company’s heavily marketed, metric-driven goals—“under 2,000
pounds and under $2,000”—were enforced by Iacocca “with an iron
hand. . . . [W]hen a crash test found that [a] one-pound, one-dollar
piece of plastic stopped the puncture of the gas tank, it was thrown
out as extra cost and extra weight.” The Pinto’s in-house green book
cited three product objectives: “True Subcompact” (size, weight);
“Low Cost of Ownership” (initial price, fuel consumption, reliability,
serviceability); and “Clear Product Superiority” (appearance,
comfort, features, ride and handling, performance). Safety was
nowhere on the list.

Hundreds of people died after Pintos were rear-ended, and
thousands more were severely injured. In 1978, Ford paid the price
with a recall of 1.5 million Pintos and sister model Mercury Bobcats,
the largest in automotive history. The company’s balance sheet and
reputation took a justified beating.

Looking back, Ford didn’t lack for objectives or key results. But
its goal-setting process was fatally flawed: “The specific, challenging
goals were met (speed to market, fuel efficiency, and cost) at the
expense of other important features that were not specified (safety,
ethical behavior, and company reputation).”

For a more recent cautionary tale, consider Wells Fargo, still
reeling from a consumer banking scandal that stemmed from
ruthless, one-dimensional sales targets. Branch managers felt
pressured to open millions of fraudulent accounts that customers
neither wanted nor needed. In one case, a manager’s teenage
daughter had twenty-four accounts, her husband twenty-one. In the
fallout, more than five thousand bankers were fired; the company’s
credit card and checking account businesses plunged by half or
more. The Wells Fargo brand may be damaged beyond repair.

The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking
a vital criterion. To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative



deliverables, one solution is to pair key results—to measure “both
effect and counter-effect,” as Grove wrote in High Output
Management. When key results focus on output, Grove noted:

[T]heir paired counterparts should stress the quality of [the] work. Thus,
in accounts payable, the number of vouchers processed should be paired
with the number of errors found either by auditing or by our suppliers.
For another example, the number of square feet cleaned by a custodial
group should be paired with a . . . rating of the quality of work as assessed
by a senior manager with an office in that building.

The Perfect and the Good

Google CEO Sundar Pichai once told me that his team often
“agonized” over their goal-setting process: “There are single OKR
lines on which you can spend an hour and a half thinking, to make
sure we are focused on doing something better for the user.” That’s
part of the territory. But to paraphrase Voltaire: Don’t allow the
perfect to be the enemy of the good.* Remember that an OKR can
be modified or even scrapped at any point in its cycle. Sometimes
the “right” key results surface weeks or months after a goal is put
into play. OKRs are inherently works in progress, not
commandments chiseled in stone.

A few goal-setting ground rules: Key results should be succinct,
specific, and measurable. A mix of outputs and inputs is helpful.



Finally, completion of all key results must result in attainment of
the objective. If not, it’s not an OKR.*

Less Is More

As Steve Jobs understood, “Innovation means saying no to one
thousand things.” In most cases, the ideal number of quarterly
OKRs will range between three and five. It may be tempting to
usher more objectives inside the velvet rope, but it’s generally a
mistake. Too many objectives can blur our focus on what counts, or
distract us into chasing the next shiny thing. At MyFitnessPal, the
health and fitness app, “We were putting too much down,” says CEO
Mike Lee. “There were too many things we were trying to get done,
and then the prioritization wasn’t clear enough. So we decided to try
to set fewer OKRs, and to make sure that the ones that really matter
are the ones that we set.”

For individuals, as I found out for myself at Intel, selective goal
setting is the first line of defense against getting overextended. Once
contributors have consulted with their managers and committed to
their OKRs for the quarter, any add-on objectives or key results
must fit into the established agenda. How does the new goal stack
up against my existing ones? Should something be dropped to
make room for the new commitment? In a high-functioning OKR
system, top-down mandates to “just do more” are obsolete. Orders



give way to questions, and to one question in particular: What
matters most?

When it came to goal setting, Andy Grove felt strongly that less is
more:

The one thing an [OKR] system should provide par excellence is focus.
This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. . . . Each
time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to
something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence
of allocating any finite resource. People who plan have to have the guts,
honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to
shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes.” . . . We must realize—and
act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on
nothing.

Above all, top-line objectives must be significant. OKRs are
neither a catchall wish list nor the sum of a team’s mundane tasks.
They’re a set of stringently curated goals that merit special attention
and will move people forward in the here and now. They link to the
larger purpose we’re expected to deliver around. “The art of
management,” Grove wrote, “lies in the capacity to select from the
many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two
or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and
concentrate on them.”

Or as Larry Page would say, winning organizations need to “put
more wood behind fewer arrows.” That, in very few and focused
words, is the essence of our first superpower.

Focus: The Remind Story

Brett Kopf
Cofounder

I t’s no news that the U.S. education system needs help. A Brown
University study pointed to one possible solution: better
communication between teachers and families. When summer

school teachers made daily phone calls and sent texts or written
messages home, their sixth-graders completed 42 percent more
homework. Class participation rose by nearly half.

For decades, companies have tried to boost student achievement
by injecting technology into schools. It hasn’t worked. But suddenly,
while nobody was looking, tens of millions of American kids walked
into the classroom with a transformational piece of tech in their
pockets. Thanks to the pervasive smartphone, text messaging
became the leading mode of teenage communication. Remind found
a market opportunity: to make texting a secure and practical
communication system for principals, teachers, students, and
parents.

Focus is essential for choosing the right goals—for winnowing
OKR wheat from chaff. Brett Kopf discovered the urgency of focus
while building Remind, enabling teachers, students, and parents to
text in a safe and secure environment. By using OKRs to zero in on
its top priorities, the company is serving millions of people who
matter for the future of this country.

When Brett and I first met, I was struck by his passion for
serving his customers. His start-up was exquisitely focused on
teachers. I’ll never forget stepping into the bathroom of his tiny loft
office and seeing a list of company objectives taped to the mirror,
over the commode. Now there was a sign of serious goal orientation.



I found Brett highly skilled at identifying priorities and enlisting
others to buy in. In 2012, he and his brother David made the Forbes
honor roll of “30 Under 30 Education.” But with accelerating scale,
their company needed more focus. OKRs guaranteed a process that
they’d already begun.

—
Brett Kopf: Growing up in Skokie, Illinois, I struggled to focus at school. I was
fine if I could move around, but sitting at a desk for me was torture. A forty-
minute math lesson felt like eternity. I was the kid who was always messing with
my neighbor or blowing spitballs. I just wasn’t engaged.

I was tested in fifth grade, and then came the diagnosis: attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia. Organizing words and letters was tough for
me. Numbers were tougher still.

Both my parents were entrepreneurs, and I’d see them up and working at
five in the morning. I was working my butt off, too, but my grades kept sinking
and my confidence with them. It only got worse in high school, on the North
Side of Chicago. When other kids called me stupid, I believed them.

Then, junior year, a teacher named Denise Whitefield began working with
me one-on-one—and changed my life. Each day she’d begin by asking, “What
do you have to do today?” I’d run down my list: a history worksheet, an English
essay, an upcoming math test. Then she’d say something really smart: “Okay,
let’s just pick one and talk about it.” We focused on one thing at a time, and I’d
get it done. “Just keep trying,” she encouraged me. “You’ll get it. I have all day.”
The panicked beating in my chest subsided. School would never be easy for
me, but I began to believe I could handle it.

My mother spoke to Mrs. Whitefield every week, came into school at least
once a month. They were a force in lockstep, Team Brett, and they would not let
me fail. I’m sure I didn’t fully get the importance of their connection, but it
planted a seed.

Even after my grades improved, the college-prep ACT exam—answer six
hundred questions and don’t move for four hours—was a horror movie for a
person with ADHD. But somehow I made it into Michigan State, my first big win.

When people try to crack the country’s massive problems in education, they
usually start with curriculum or “accountability,” which is code for test scores.
What gets lost are the human connections. That’s what Remind is all about.

Twitter for Education
Like many ventures, Remind began with one person’s problem. As a college
freshman, I was hopeless with academic deadlines and schedules, which my
professors seemed to change on a whim. Cut off from my support system, I



failed at three majors before settling on agricultural economics, the easiest one I
could find. But I still had five syllabi per semester, and each syllabus might
contain thirty-five assignments and quizzes and tests. Success in college is a
matter of time management. When to start writing that ten-page poli-sci essay?
How to prep for the chem final? It’s all about dynamic goal setting, and I kept
dropping the ball.

Things came to a head junior year, after I slaved over an essay and got a
mediocre grade. Adding insult, I had to hunt for that lousy grade on a clunky
web-based system on my laptop. My friends and I texted on our BlackBerrys in
real time—why couldn’t our school data be at our fingertips, too? Why couldn’t
teachers connect with students on their smartphones anytime, anywhere? I felt
driven to build something to help kids like me. I called my older brother, David,
who was working in web services security for a big Chicago insurance firm. I
said, “You have twenty-four hours to decide if you want to start that company
with me.” Five minutes later he called back and said, “Okay, I’m in.”

For two years, David and I fumbled in the dark. We knew nothing about
technology and less about product development or operations. (My total real-
world experience was an internship at Kraft Foods, where I’d mostly stocked
cookies.) Random students shared their syllabi, and I plugged them into David’s
Excel macros to send alerts to their phones: “Brett Kopf, you have a quiz at
eight a.m. tomorrow in History 101, don’t forget to study.” The system was
archaic and absolutely unscalable. But for a few hundred active users, including
me, it worked. I graduated from Michigan State.

In early 2011, I moved to Chicago to work on our app full time. With $30,000
from friends and family, David and I did the full-monty entrepreneur thing, pasta
dinners every night. And we failed because I was arrogant. We spent lots of
time meeting potential investors and working up intricate website schematics,
and no time learning about teachers’ problems. We weren’t yet focused on what
counted.

Down to a few hundred dollars, our company cheated death by getting into
Imagine K12, the Silicon Valley start-up accelerator for the education market.
Our mission statement went something like: “Remind101: A safe way for
teachers to message students and parents. We’re building the most powerful
communication platform in education and using SMS as the ‘hook.’ Think
Twitter, for education.” There were millions of children with learning issues like
mine, and countless teachers struggling to help them. I was bold or naive
enough to think we could do something about it.

With our Demo Day opportunity ninety days out, David quit his job and we
moved to the Valley. We learned the three watchwords for entrepreneurs:

Solve a problem
Build a simple product
Talk to your users

While David locked himself in a room to teach himself how to code, I focused
on a single ten-week goal: to interview 200 teachers across the United States



and Canada. (I guess you could say that was my first OKR.) After contacting
500 teachers on Twitter, I wound up with 250 one-on-ones, exceeding my
objective. When you listen to enough educators in the trenches, you learn pretty
quickly that off-site communication ranks high among their pain points. At final
bell, teachers were plastering sticky notes—Homework’s due tomorrow—on
students’ shoulders. Couldn’t we do better than that?

Traditional phone trees and permission slips were labor intensive and
unreliable. On the other hand, texting between thirty-year-old teachers and
twelve-year-old children was loaded with liability. Teachers needed a secure
platform with no personal data attached, something accessible yet private. And
they needed less work, not more.

By Day 15, we had a crude beta version of Remind. On a sheet of printer
paper, over hand-drawn symbols for mobile phones and email, I scrawled,
“Your students can receive your messages. . . .” Below were three options:
“Invite,” “Print,” “Share.” After reaching a teacher on Skype, I’d hold the paper to
the screen and say, “You can type any message you want to your students, hit
the button, and they’ll never see your phone number or social networking
profile.” I did this countless times, and the teachers just about fell out of their
chairs—every time. “My God,” they’d say, “that would solve such a big problem
for me!”

That’s when David and I knew we were on the right track.

Scaling on a Shoestring
By Day 70, our software was in place. Teachers could sign up on the web, form
a virtual “class,” and provide a dedicated number to students and parents for
text messaging. We scaled quickly, a good sign—130,000 messages within
three weeks of launch. We had what every new company wanted, a hockey-
stick growth chart. On Demo Day, I entered a big, buzzing room with eleven
other start-ups and a hundred investors. I had two minutes to make my pitch,
followed by two hours of frantic mingling. I handed out my card to at least forty
people.

Growth costs money. By early 2012, my brother and I were $10,000 in debt.
But then Miriam Rivera and Clint Korver’s Ulu Ventures seeded us with a save-
the-day $30,000. Another infusion followed from Maneesh Arora, the Google
product manager who later founded MightyText and became my mentor.
Remind kept scaling like crazy on our seed-capital shoestring. Sometimes—
most of the time—it felt like the sorcerer’s apprentice, moving really fast and out
of control. At one point we were adding eighty thousand users a day when we
had five people, and only two of us were engineers. We’d yet to spend a dime
on marketing. I spoke to teachers for feedback, and they’d put out the word to
fifty colleagues. Since our service was free, we didn’t need school district
approval.



Our goals stayed strictly qualitative until the fall of 2013, when we hit six
million users and raised Series A funding from Chamath Palihapitiya and the
Social+Capital Partnership. Maneesh had already been nudging us to back our
decisions with more data, and Chamath showed us how to paint a picture with
one page of it. Plus he taught us to discern what was inessential, like our
number of registered users. Nobody cared how many teachers registered on
Remind if they never came back to use it.

By the time John Doerr saw our goals posted above our office toilet, they
were more concrete. We listed three metrics: Weekly Active Teachers (WAT),
Monthly Active Teachers (MAT), and retention.

Then I’d squeeze in a few quarterly initiatives: migrate the databases, build
the app, hire four people. I wanted everyone in the company to see just what we
were doing.

Working out of a one-bedroom loft, still plagued by a chronic shortage of
engineers, we’d barely gotten our mobile app up and running. But John could
tell we were homed in on what mattered. Our objectives were clear and
quantified, and we were teacher-obsessed from the start.

In February 2014, just before we closed our Series B funding (led by Kleiner
Perkins), John pitched us on OKRs. He told us about some companies using
them: Intel, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter. Here was a method to keep us focused,
to guide and track and support us at every step. And I thought: Why not try it?

Goals for Growth
That August, the heart of our busy back-to-school season, the Remind app
exploded: more than 300,000 student and parent downloads per day. We were
number three in the Apple App Store! By the end of the fall semester, we’d
passed the billion-message mark. Our operation had to ramp up in a hurry, in
each and every department. None of our goal setting was glamorous, but all of
it was very necessary.

Meloney Cargill and Dawn Sanchez, Remind cofounder David Kopf, 2012.

We started OKRs when our company had fourteen people. Within two years,
we’d grown to sixty. We couldn’t all meet around a table anymore to hash out
the next quarter’s priorities. OKRs helped enormously by helping people to
focus on what could move the company to the next level. To meet our objective
for teacher engagement, with its time-bound key result, we had to defer many
other things. In my view, you can only do one big thing at a time really well, and
so you better know what that one thing is.

OBJECTIVE
Support company hiring.

KEY RESULTS
1. Hire 1 director of finance and operations (talk to at least

3 candidates).
2. Source 1 product marketing manager (meet with 5

candidates this quarter).
3. Source 1 product manager (meet with 5 candidates this

quarter).



For example: To this day, one of our most requested features is a repeated
message. Say a teacher wants to remind a fifth-grade class to bring the novel
they’re reading to school—and keep reminding them every Monday morning
without resending. That’s a classic “delight” feature, but was it worth the
engineering time to make it a top-line priority? Would it move the needle for
user engagement? When our answer was no, we decided to shelve it—a tough
call for a teacher-centric organization. Without our new goal-setting discipline
and focus, we might not have held our ground.

OKRs gave us a way to move forward that wasn’t all top-down. After voting
on the quarter’s top objectives, the leadership team would go to our contributors
and say, “Here’s what we think is important and why.” And the contributors
would say, “Okay, how do we get there?” Since it was all written down,
everybody knew what everyone else was doing. There was no confusion or
Monday-morning quarterbacking. OKRs took politics out of play.

The system helped my personal focus, too. I tried to limit myself to three or
four individual objectives, tops. I printed them out and kept them close on my
notepad and next to my computer, everywhere I went. Each morning, I’d say to
myself, “These are my three buckets, and what am I doing today to move the
company forward?” That’s a great question for any leader, with or without a
learning issue.

I was wide open about my progress or lack of it. I’d tell my people, “Here are
the three things I’m working on, and I’m failing at this one miserably.” As
companies scale, people need to see the CEO’s priorities and how they can
align for maximum impact. And they need to see it’s okay to make a mistake, to
correct it and move on. You can’t fear screwing up. That squelches innovation.

At a fast-growing start-up, effective leaders keep firing themselves from jobs
they did at the beginning. Like many founders, I handled accounting and payroll,
which drained a lot of time. One of my first OKRs was to offload the financial
tasks and focus on product and strategy, our big-picture objectives. Meanwhile,
I had to adjust to working through a layer of executives. My OKRs smoothed the
transition and made it stick. They kept me from backsliding or micromanaging.

An OKR Legacy
OKRs are basically simple, but you don’t master the process off the bat. Early
on, we’d be off by miles in our company-level objectives, mostly on the way-too-
ambitious side. We might set seven or eight of them when we had the capacity
for two, at best.

When John entered our lives, I was new to strategic planning. We probably
should have eased into OKRs more slowly and not installed the whole system
at once. But whatever our mistakes, I’d do it again in a heartbeat. OKRs helped
Remind become a better-managed company, a company that executes. Three



quarters after our first implementation, we secured $40 million in Series C
funding. Our future was assured.

The sky’s the limit for Remind. Through all its growth and changes,
it has never lost sight of its core constituency, those hardworking
teachers. Brett and David Kopf are unwavering in their vision “to
give every student an opportunity to succeed.” As Brett says: We live
in a time when you can click a button and get a cab within five
minutes. But when a child lags in school, it can take weeks or
months for a parent to find out about it. Remind is on its way to
solving that problem—by focusing on what matters.

Commit: The Nuna Story

Jini Kim
Cofounder and CEO

N una is the story of the passionate Jini Kim, propelled by
family tragedy to deliver better health care to huge numbers
of Americans. Of how she bootstrapped Nuna through years

of rejection. And of how she recruited engineers and data scientists
to commit to a wildly audacious goal: building a new Medicaid data
platform, from scratch.

Alongside focus, commitment is a core element of our first
superpower. In implementing OKRs, leaders must publicly commit
to their objectives and stay steadfast. At Nuna, a health care data
platform and analytics company, the cofounders overcame a false
start with OKRs. They went on to clarify priorities for the entire
organization. They realized that they needed to show a sustained
commitment to reach their own individual OKRs, and to help their
team do the same.

Nuna took off in 2014. Four years and one enormous Medicaid
contract later, the company is leveraging data to make the health
care system work better for millions of people who need it most.
Applying the technology and lessons learned from its Medicaid
work, Nuna is helping large companies improve the efficiency and
quality of care in their private plans. All of this work is supported by
the goal-setting prowess of OKRs, which Jini first encountered as a
Google product manager.

This story reflects two aspects of our commitment superpower.
Once Nuna’s team got the hang of them, OKRs locked in their
commitment to their highest-impact goals. At the same time, both



leaders and contributors learned to commit to the OKR process
itself.

—
Jini Kim: The story of Nuna is very personal. When my brother Kimong was
two years old, he was diagnosed with severe autism. A few years later, he had
his first grand mal seizure at Disneyland. One second he was fine, and the next
he was on the floor, barely able to breathe. As Korean immigrants with limited
resources and little English, my parents felt helpless. Without a safety net, my
family would surely have gone bankrupt. The task of signing us up for Medicaid
fell to me, at age nine.

When I joined Google in 2004, my first job out of college, I’d never heard of
OKRs. But over time, they became an indispensable compass to help me and
my teams navigate through Google and get the most important work done. One
of the first products I worked on, Google Health, taught me the importance of
data for improving health care. I also learned just how difficult it can be to gain
access to health care data, even one’s own. In 2010, that experience led me to
found Nuna.

We didn’t use OKRs in the beginning. Nuna had no money and no
customers. I was working full time and five others part time (including my grad
student cofounder, David Chen), but no one was getting paid. We stitched
together a prototype and talked to some large self-insured employers. That first
year we got zero orders, and rightfully so. We thought we knew what the market
needed, but we didn’t yet understand our customers well enough to effectively
advocate for the product.



Nuna CEO Jini Kim with brother Kimong.

When we still had no orders in year two, I knew it was time to get an
education. What did benefits directors actually care about? What did meaningful
innovation look like in the health care market? I put on a suit and crashed some
human resources conferences to find out.

In 2012, the things I’d learned helped us sign some Fortune 500 companies
as clients. More than two years of rejection, frustration, and more ramen dinners
than I could count had finally led Nuna to a product-market fit. But at a start-up,
the only constant is change, and Nuna was about to undergo a dramatic one.
After I returned to the Bay Area from a six-month stint with Healthcare.gov, we
closed $30 million of funding. We’d finally be able to pay our team, and for
many years to come.

By that point, I’d learned of a government request-for-proposals to build the
first-ever database for all Medicaid members: 74.5 million lives in fifty states,
five territories, and the District of Columbia. The effort had already failed
multiple times. After seventy-two hours fueled by adrenaline and Red Bull, we
submitted our bid just on time to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS). Two months after that, we found out we had won the contract.

Scaling Nuna was an enormous undertaking, in three dimensions. The first
was the business itself, to upgrade compliance, security, and privacy. The
second was our data platform infrastructure. The third was our employee base,
from fifteen people to seventy-five. We’d have to construct a historic database
while still running our existing employer business—and to finish within a year.
To deliver, we’d need more focus and commitment than ever before.

In 2015, we made an initial try to implement OKRs. As an ex-Googler, I was
sold on the power of objectives and key results. But I underestimated what it
took to introduce them, much less to execute them effectively. You need to build
your goal muscle gradually, incrementally. As I know too well from my own
private wellness OKR to run a marathon: Doing too much too soon will definitely
end in pain.

We created quarterly OKRs and annual OKRs, and rolled them out to
everybody at Nuna from day one. We were tiny then, around twenty people—
not such a big lift, you might think. But the process didn’t take. Some people
never set their individual OKRs; others set them, but stuck them in a drawer.

With hindsight, I would have started with our leadership team of five. For
structured goal setting to prosper, as our company learned the hard way,
executives need to commit to the process. It may take a quarter or two to
overcome your managers’ resistance and get them acclimated to OKRs—to
view them not as a necessary evil, or some perfunctory exercise, but as a
practical tool to fulfill your organization’s top priorities.

Until your executives are fully on board, you can’t expect contributors to
follow suit—especially when a company’s OKRs are aspirational. The more
challenging an objective, the more tempting it may be to abandon it. People
naturally look to their bosses in setting goals and following through. If the



officers jump ship in the middle of a stormy voyage, you can’t expect the sailors
to bring it into port.

In mid-2016, we tried again, with a renewed level of OKR commitment. But
even as I saw our executive team buy in, I knew I couldn’t be complacent. As
the leader, it was my job to keep after people. I would email our contributors to
commit to creating individual OKRs. If they didn’t respond, I would reach out to
them via Slack, the team messaging app. If they still didn’t hear me, I would text
them. And if they still didn’t listen, I would grab them and say, “Please do your
OKRs!”

To inspire true commitment, leaders must practice what they teach. They
must model the behavior they expect of others. After sharing my individual
OKRs at an all-hands meeting, I was surprised by just how much it helped the
company rally around the process. It showed everyone that I, too, was
accountable. Our contributors feel free to evaluate my OKRs and tell me how to
improve them, which has made all the difference. Here’s one example, with my
grades (on the Google scale of 0.0 to 1.0) in brackets. I can tell you that I
received a lot of constructive input in formulating this deceptively simple and
make-or-break hiring OKR:

OBJECTIVE
Continue to build a world-class team.

KEY RESULTS
1. Recruit 10 engineers [0.8].
2. Hire commercial sales leader [1.0].
3. One hundred percent of candidates feel they had a well-

organized, professional experience even if Nuna does
not extend an offer [0.5].

We also added two key results to measure our commitment to professional
development:

OBJECTIVE
Create a healthy and productive work environment as we

scale to more than 150 employees.

KEY RESULTS
1. One hundred percent of Nunas have gone through

performance review/feedback cycle [1.0].
2. One hundred percent of Nunas score their individual Q3

OKRs within the first week of Q4 [0.4].



At Nuna, our commitment to OKRs is very public and visible. But there are
times when the system is more useful in a private mode. In the fourth quarter of
2016, I set my sights on hiring a VP for our employer business, a critical step to
accelerate the growth of that business unit. It was a new position for the
company, and I was unsure how it would be perceived internally. Establishing a
private OKR, for which only David and I were accountable, deepened my
commitment to get the hiring process moving. It pushed me to speak one-on-
one to key stakeholders in the company, find potential recruits, and finally set
into motion a more formal recruitment process.

By definition, start-ups wrestle with ambiguity. As Nuna’s terrain has
expanded, from self-insured employers to the massive Medicaid database to a
suite of new health plan products, we’ve come to rely on OKRs more than ever.
Our whole team needs sharper focus and clearer priorities, the prerequisites for
deeper commitment. OKRs have forced a bunch of conversations in the
company that otherwise would not have happened. We’re getting more
alignment. Instead of reacting to external events on the fly, we’re acting
purposefully on our plans for each quarter. Our deadlines are stricter, yet they
also feel more attainable. We’re committed to doing what we’ve said we will do.

What’s the moral of our OKR story? As David says, “You’re not going to get
the system just right the first time around. It’s not going to be perfect the second
or third time, either. But don’t get discouraged. Persevere. You need to adapt it
and make it your own.” Commitment feeds on itself. Stay the course with OKRs,
as I know firsthand, and you will reap amazing benefits.

Today, with the invaluable support of our CMS partners, Nuna has built a
secure, flexible data platform to store private health information for more than
74 million Americans. But we aspire to do so much more. We want our platform
to inform policy makers as they grapple with governing a costly and complex
health care system. We want it to drive analytics, to help predict and prevent
future ailments. Most of all, we want it to play a big role in improving the nation’s
health care. It’s a daunting commitment. But as I learned at Google: The hairier
the mission, the more important your OKRs.

All these years later, my little brother Kimong speaks only three words:
uhma, appa, and nuna—Korean for mom, dad, and big sister. Kimong gave our
company both its name and its mission. Now it’s up to us, backed by our
commitment to OKRs, to help improve health care for everyone.

—
In January 2017, Nuna peeled back the curtain on its Medicaid
work. Interviewed by The New York Times, Andrew M. Slavitt,
acting director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,
described Nuna’s cloud database as “near historic,” a leap from
state-level computing silos to the first “systemwide view across the
program.”

In just a few short years, Nuna’s team has made a lasting impact
on the U.S. health care system. But anyone who knows Jini and



David—and the strength of their commitment to OKRs—will tell you
they are just getting started.

Superpower #2: Align and Connect
for Teamwork

We don’t hire smart people to tell them what to do.
We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.

—Steve Jobs

W ith the eruption of social media, transparency is the default
setting for our daily lives. It’s the express lane to operating
excellence. Yet at most companies today, goals remain

secrets. Too many CEOs share the frustration of Aaron Levie,
founder and CEO of Box, the enterprise cloud company. “At any
given time,” Aaron said, “some significant percentage of people are
working on the wrong things. The challenge is knowing which
ones.”

Research shows that public goals are more likely to be attained
than goals held in private. Simply flipping the switch to “open” lifts
achievement across the board. In a recent survey of one thousand
working U.S. adults, 92 percent said they’d be more motivated to
reach their goals if colleagues could see their progress.

In an OKR system, the most junior staff can look at everyone’s
goals, on up to the CEO. Critiques and corrections are out in public
view. Contributors have carte blanche to weigh in, even on flaws in
the goal-setting process itself. Meritocracy flourishes in sunlight.
When people write down “This is what I’m working on,” it’s easier to
see where the best ideas are coming from. Soon it’s apparent that
the individuals moving up are the ones doing what the company
most values. Organizational poisons—suspicion, sandbagging,
politicking—lose their toxic power. If sales hates the latest
marketing plan, they won’t be simmering inside their silo; their



differences will be aired out in the open. OKRs make objectives
objective, in black and white.

Transparency seeds collaboration. Say Employee A is struggling
to reach a quarterly objective. Because she has publicly tracked her
progress, colleagues can see she needs help. They jump in, posting
comments and offering support. The work improves. Equally
important, work relationships are deepened, even transformed.

In larger organizations, it’s common to find several people
unwittingly working on the same thing. By clearing a line of sight to
everyone’s objectives, OKRs expose redundant efforts and save time
and money.

The Same Page

Once top-line objectives are set, the real work begins. As they shift
from planning to execution, managers and contributors alike tie
their day-to-day activities to the organization’s vision. The term for
this linkage is alignment, and its value cannot be overstated.
According to the Harvard Business Review, companies with highly
aligned employees are more than twice as likely to be top
performers.

Unfortunately, alignment is rare. Studies suggest that only 7
percent of employees “fully understand their company’s business
strategies and what’s expected of them in order to help achieve the
common goals.” A lack of alignment, according to a poll of global
CEOs, is the number-one obstacle between strategy and execution.

“We’ve got a lot of stuff going on,” says Amelia Merrill, an HR
leader at RMS, a California risk modeling agency. “We’ve got people
in multiple offices in multiple time zones—some doing parallel
work, some doing work together. And it’s really hard for employees
to see what they should work on first. Everything seems important;
everything seems urgent. But what really needs to get done?”

The answer lies in focused, transparent OKRs. They knit each
individual’s work to team efforts, departmental projects, and the
overall mission. As a species, we crave connection. In the workplace,
we’re naturally curious about what our leaders are doing and how
our work weaves into theirs. OKRs are the vehicle of choice for
vertical alignment.



The Grand Cascade

In the bygone business world, work was strictly driven from the top.
Goals were handed down the org chart like tablets from Mount
Sinai. Senior executives set top-line objectives for their department
heads, who passed them to the next tier of management, and so on
down the line.

While this approach to goal-setting is no longer universal, it
remains prevalent at most larger organizations. The appeal is
obvious. Cascaded goals corral lower-level employees and guarantee
that they’re working on the company’s chief concerns. In the best
case, cascading forges unity; it makes plain that we’re all in this
together.

In my pitch to Google and many other organizations, I’ve used an
imaginary football team to show how the OKR system works
effectively—or not—when used in this fashion.

Follow along as we cascade a set of OKRs from top to bottom.

The Sand Hill Unicorns: Fantasy Football

Let’s say I’m the general manager of the Sand Hill Unicorns. I have
one objective, the WHAT: Make money for the owner.

OKR Chart 1 — General Manager

My objective has two key results: win the Super Bowl and fill the
stands to at least 90 percent capacity, which is HOW I will make



money for the owner. If I fulfill both of those HOWs, there is no way
we can fail to show a profit. So it’s a well-constructed OKR.

With our top-level OKRs set, we work our way down the
organization.

OKR Chart 2 — Coaches



As general manager, I cascade my goal down to the next level of
management, the head coach and the senior vice president of
marketing. My key results become their objectives. (See OKR Chart
2.) The head coach’s objective is to win the Super Bowl, with three
key results to get him there: a passing attack of at least 300 yards
per game, a defense surrendering fewer than seventeen points per
game, and a top three ranking in punt return coverage. He cascades
those KRs as objectives for his top three executives, the offensive
and defensive coordinators and special teams coach. They in turn
devise their own, lower-level key results. To achieve a 300-yards-
per-game passing attack, for example, the offensive coordinator
might aim for a 65 percent pass completion rate and less than one
interception per game—after hiring a new quarterbacks coach.

These OKRs are aligned to the general manager’s aim to win
the Super Bowl.

We are not done yet. We need to define how we’ll fill up our
home stands.



OKR Chart 3—OKRs for the Organization

Meanwhile, my SVP of marketing has derived her objective from
my other key result, to fill the stands to 90 percent capacity. (See
OKR Chart 3.) She’s crafted three key results: Upgrade the team’s
branding, improve our media coverage, and revitalize the in-
stadium promotion program. These KRs are cascaded as objectives
for the marketing director, team publicist, and merchandise
manager, respectively.

Now, what’s wrong with this picture? Here’s a clue: The SVP’s
key results are a mess. Unlike the head coach’s KRs, they’re
unmeasurable. They’re not specific or time bound. How do we



define “improvement,” for example, in the team’s media coverage?
(Five special features on ESPN? One cover spread in Sports
Illustrated? Fifty percent more followers on social media?)

But even if the SVP came up with stronger key results, the
organization’s goal-setting approach would remain deeply flawed.
The top-line objective—to make a wealthy person wealthier—lacks
intrinsic motivation for the general manager, much less for the
team’s East Coast scout or the PR intern slaving away at the copy
machine.

In moderation, cascading makes an operation more coherent.
But when all objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a
mechanical, color-by-numbers exercise, with four adverse effects:

A loss of agility. Even medium-size companies can have six
or seven reporting levels. As everyone waits for the
waterfall to trickle down from above, and meetings and
reviews sprout like weeds, each goal cycle can take weeks or
even months to administer. Tightly cascading organizations
tend to resist fast and frequent goal setting.
Implementation is so cumbersome that quarterly OKRs
may prove impractical.
A lack of flexibility. Since it takes so much effort to
formulate cascaded goals, people are reluctant to revise
them mid-cycle. Even minor updates can burden those
downstream, who are scrambling to keep their goals
aligned. Over time, the system grows onerous to maintain.

Marginalized contributors. Rigidly cascaded systems tend
to shut out input from frontline employees. In a top-down
ecosystem, contributors will hesitate to share goal-related
concerns or promising ideas.
One-dimensional linkages. While cascading locks in
vertical alignment, it’s less effective in connecting peers
horizontally, across departmental lines.

Bottoms Up!



Fortunately, we have an alternative. Precisely because OKRs are
transparent, they can be shared without cascading them in lockstep.
If it serves the larger purpose, multiple levels of hierarchy can be
skipped over. Rather than laddering down from the CEO to a VP to
a director to a manager (and then to the manager’s reports), an
objective might jump from the CEO straight to a manager, or from a
director to an individual contributor. Or the company’s leadership
might present its OKRs to everyone at once and trust people to say,
“Okay, now I see where we’re going, and I’ll adapt my goals to that.”

Considering that Google has tens of thousands of employees, its
innovative culture would be hamstrung by OKRs cascaded by rote.
As Laszlo Bock, a former head of the company’s People Operations,
observes in Work Rules!:

Having goals improves performance. Spending hours cascading goals up
and down the company, however, does not. . . . We have a market-based
approach, where over time our goals all converge because the top OKRs
are known and everyone else’s OKRs are visible. Teams that are grossly
out of alignment stand out, and the few major initiatives that touch
everyone are easy enough to manage directly.

The antithesis of cascading might be Google’s “20 percent time,”
which frees engineers to work on side projects for the equivalent of
one day per week. By liberating some of the sharpest minds in
captivity, Google has changed the world as we know it. In 2001, the
young Paul Buchheit initiated a 20 percent project with the code
name Caribou. It’s now known as Gmail, the world’s leading web-
based email service.

To avoid compulsive, soul-killing overalignment, healthy
organizations encourage some goals to emerge from the bottom up.
Say the Sand Hill Unicorns’ physical therapist attends a sports
medicine conference and learns of a new regimen for injury
prevention. Of her own volition, she coins an off-season OKR to
implement the therapy. Her objective may not align with her direct
manager’s OKRs, but it aligns with the general manager’s
overarching objective. If the Unicorns’ top players stay healthy
through the season, the team’s chances of winning the Super Bowl
will soar.

Innovation tends to dwell less at the center of an organization
than at its edges. The most powerful OKRs typically stem from
insights outside the C-suite. As Andy Grove observed, “People in the



trenches are usually in touch with impending changes early.
Salespeople understand shifting customer demands before
management does; financial analysts are the earliest to know when
the fundamentals of a business change.”

Micromanagement is mismanagement. A healthy OKR
environment strikes a balance between alignment and autonomy,
common purpose and creative latitude. The “professional
employee,” Peter Drucker wrote, “needs rigorous performance
standards and high goals. . . . But how he does his work should
always be his responsibility and his decision.” At Intel, Grove took a
dim view of “managerial meddling”: “[T]he subordinate will begin
to take a much more restricted view of what is expected of him,
showing less initiative in solving his own problems and referring
them instead to his [or her] supervisor. . . . [T]he output of the
organization will consequently be reduced. . . .”

An optimal OKR system frees contributors to set at least some of
their own objectives and most or all of their key results. People are
led to stretch above and beyond, to set more ambitious targets and
achieve more of those they set: “The higher the goals, the higher the
performance.” People who choose their destination will own a
deeper awareness of what it takes to get there.

When our how is defined by others, the goal won’t engage us to
the same degree. If my doctor orders me to lower my blood pressure
by training for the San Francisco Marathon, I might grudgingly take
it under advisement. But if I decide of my own free will to run the
race, I’m far more likely to reach the finish line—especially if I’m
running with friends.

In business, I have found, there is rarely a single right answer. By
loosening the reins and backing people to find their right answers,
we help everybody win. High-functioning teams thrive on a creative
tension between top-down and bottom-up goal setting, a mix of
aligned and unaligned OKRs. In times of operational urgency, when
simple doing takes precedence, organizations may choose to be
more directive. But when the numbers are strong and a company
has grown too cautious and buttoned-up, a lighter touch may be just
right. When leaders are attuned to the fluctuating needs of both the
business and their employees, the mix of top-down and bottom-up
goals generally settles at around half-and-half. Which sounds about
right to me.



Cross-functional Coordination

Even as modern goal setting successfully transcends the org chart,
unacknowledged dependencies remain the number one cause of
project slippage. The cure is lateral, cross-functional connectivity,
peer-to-peer and team-to-team. For innovation and advanced
problem solving, isolated individuals cannot match a connected
group. Product relies on engineering, marketing on sales. As
business becomes more intricate and initiatives more complex,
interdependent divisions need a tool to help them reach the finish
line together.

Connected companies are quicker companies. To grab a
competitive advantage, both leaders and contributors need to link
up horizontally, breaking through barriers. A transparent OKR
system, as Laszlo Bock points out, promotes this sort of
freewheeling collaboration: “People across the whole organization
can see what’s going on. Suddenly you have people who are
designing a handset reaching out to another team doing software,
because they saw an interesting thing you could do with the user
interface.”

When goals are public and visible to all, a “team of teams” can
attack trouble spots wherever they surface. Adds Bock: “You can see
immediately if somebody’s hitting the ball out of the park—you
investigate. If somebody’s missing all the time, you investigate.
Transparency creates very clear signals for everyone. You kick off
virtuous cycles that reinforce your ability to actually get your work
done. And the management tax is zero—it’s amazing.”

Align: The MyFitnessPal Story

Mike Lee
Cofounder and CEO

I t all started with a beach wedding. Heading into their nuptials,
Mike and Amy Lee wanted to lose some weight. A fitness trainer
gave them a list of the nutritional values of three thousand foods

—and a pad of paper for tracking calories. Mike, who’d programmed
computers since the age of ten, knew there had to be a better way.
So he conceived a solution, which became MyFitnessPal. For eight
years, Mike and Albert self-funded the app from savings and credit
cards.

Today, the brothers Lee are at the center of an epic movement for
quantitative, self-digital health and personal well-being. Their
mission is to create a healthy planet. In 2013, when Kleiner Perkins
invested in MyFitnessPal, the app had 45 million registered users.
Today it has more than 120 million, and they’ve lost a collective 300
million pounds. With a database of 14 million foods plus real-time
links to Fitbit and dozens of other apps, MyFitnessPal makes it
easier than ever to track what you eat and how effectively you
exercise. By revealing what used to be hidden—the calories you burn
on your morning run, for example—MyFitnessPal helps users set
and achieve ambitious personal goals. Members make daily choices
that change their lives. As a bonus, the app comes with a network of
friends who cheer you on each day.

OKRs are not islands. To the contrary, they create networks—
vertical, horizontal, diagonal—to connect an organization’s most
vital work. When employees align with a company’s top-line goals,
their impact is amplified. They stop duplicating efforts or working
counterproductively against the grain. As brothers Mike and Albert



Lee discovered while building MyFitnessPal, the world’s leading
health and fitness app, strong alignment is critical to the day-to-day
progress that kindles the next big leap.

If this story sounds like a perfect setting for OKRs, you’re not
mistaken. Goal setting came organically for Mike and Albert—
though not always easily, as you will see. In February 2015, their
company was acquired by Under Armour for $475 million. The
merger married MyFitnessPal’s strength in technology to one of the
industry’s great brands. Suddenly the Lees had access to world-class
professional athletes, the next frontier for digital fitness. As Mike
says, “We want to skate to where the puck is going.”

The new business structure brought new challenges for goal
setting, around alignment in particular. Mike and Albert would rely
on OKRs to navigate a labyrinth of internal relationships. As
MyFitnessPal dove into a much larger pond, objectives and key
results would align its growing team and their goals.

Mike Lee: You have a device in your pocket that’s incredibly powerful. The data
it collects—on yourself and the world around you—is exploding. For a nominal
cost or none at all, you can have a coach or a nutritionist or even a medical
consultant on hand at all times. Thanks to our smartphones, we can make
healthier decisions and lead healthier lifestyles.

MyFitnessPal provides insights—we call them “moments of clarity”—that
stick with our users all their lives. I know firsthand that it works. When I first
began tracking what I ate, I learned that mayonnaise has ninety calories per
tablespoon, and mustard only five. I haven’t touched a drop of mayo since.
Make enough of those small changes, and you’ll find they add up.

I worked for a number of companies before cofounding MyFitnessPal. None
of them used formal goal-setting systems. They had annual financial plans,
revenue numbers to hit, and broad strategies around them, but nothing
structured or continuous. Not coincidentally, those organizations shared
something else in common: a glaring lack of alignment. I’d have no clue as to
what other teams were doing, or how we might work together toward a common
objective. We’d try to compensate with more meetings, which only wasted time.
If you put two people in a boat and have one row east and the other row west,
they’ll use up lots of energy going nowhere.

In our early days at MyFitnessPal, we’d joke that we had a thousand-item to-
do list, and we’d cross off the top three items and say, “Okay, that was a good
year.” We left a lot below the line, but that was okay. We worked within our
limits: launch the Android app, or the BlackBerry app, or the iPhone or iPad
version. We tackled one goal at a time and worked until it was done, and then
we moved to the next item on the list. Rarely was there overlap.



Our process wasn’t sophisticated, but it was focused and highly measurable.
When you’re defining a company’s strategy on your own, with just one other
person working on products, alignment is simple. My brother and I would
declare a keystone goal—launch on the iPad by such-and-such a date—and
communicate each day on our progress. Small organizations can get by with
less process. Though now I wish we’d had our OKRs in gear earlier on, even
before we got funded. We’d have been better prepared to make sounder
choices when opportunity came our way.

MyFitnessPal cofounders Mike and Albert Lee, 2012.

Once MyFitnessPal got up and running on the iPhone and Android, our
growth shot off the charts. One day we woke up and had 35 million registered
users. We were scaling too fast to do one thing at a time anymore. I found that
entropy begins when you have two great people directly under you. You want to
give each of them something big and purposeful to work on, and they both
naturally want to move their piece of the project, and soon they’re pulling out of
alignment and charging in different directions. Before you know it, they’re
working on two different things. It doesn’t help to push them harder. If two nails
are even slightly misaligned, a good hammer will splay them sideways.

Though Albert and I knew we needed more structure in our goal setting, we
weren’t certain how to proceed. In 2013, not long after Kleiner Perkins first
invested in our company, John Doerr came by to pitch us on OKRs. His football
team analogy resonated with me; I just got it. I loved the simplicity of the main
objective, and the way it was distilled and stretched and cascaded through the



organization. And I thought to myself: That was how we’d get our company
aligned.

Cross-team Integration
When we began to implement OKRs, it was harder than anticipated. We didn’t
appreciate how much thought it took to create the right company objectives, and
then to cascade them down to drive contributors’ behavior. We found it
challenging to strike a balance between high-level, strategic thinking and more
granular, directive communication. Once we had our Series A funding and
scaled up our leadership team, our realm of the possible expanded. In a push
for accountability, we set one big dedicated goal for each leader. We created
company OKRs for people instead of matching people to our OKRs—we had it
backward. Some objectives were too narrow, others too nebulous. If an HR
manager got stuck trying to connect to the high-level goals for product or
revenue, we’d add a top-line objective just for that person. Soon we had a
cornucopia of company OKRs, but what really mattered at MyFitnessPal? We’d
lost the forest for the trees.

In 2013, as we jumped from ten to thirty people, I assumed we’d become
200 percent more productive. I’d underestimated how much scaling slows you
down. New engineers need extensive training before they can be as proficient
as your holdovers. And with multiple engineers developing the same project, we
had to build new processes to keep them from overriding one another. In the
transition, productivity took a hit.

When you come down to it, alignment is about helping people understand
what you want them to do. Most contributors will be motivated to ladder up to
the top-line OKRs—assuming they know where to set the ladder. As our team
got larger and more layered, we confronted new issues. One product manager
was working on Premium, the enhanced subscription version of our app.
Another focused on our API platform, to enable third parties like Fitbit to
connect to MyFitnessPal and write data to it or applications on top of it. The
third addressed our core login experience. All three had individual OKRs for
what they hoped to accomplish—so far, so good.

The problem was our shared engineering team, which got caught in the
middle. The engineers weren’t aligned with the product managers’ objectives.
They had their own infrastructure OKRs, to keep the plumbing going and the
lights on. We assumed they could do it all—a big mistake. They got confused
about what they should be working on, which could change without notice.
(Sometimes it boiled down to which product manager yelled loudest.) As the
engineers switched between projects from week to week, their efficiency
dragged. When returning to a product after an interruption, they’d have to ask
themselves: How does this go again? The Premium work was especially urgent
for revenue, yet it went in fits and starts.



I felt super-frustrated. We’d hired all these talented people and were
spending tons of money, but we weren’t going any faster. Things came to a
head over a top-priority marketing OKR for personalized emails with targeted
content. The objective was well constructed: We wanted to drive a certain
minimum number of monthly active users to our blog. One important key result
was to increase our click-through rate from emails. The catch was that no one in
marketing had thought to inform engineering, which had already set its own
priorities that quarter. Without buy-in from the engineers, the OKR was doomed
before it started. Even worse, Albert and I didn’t find out it was doomed until our
quarterly postmortem. (The project got done a quarter late.)

That was our wake-up call, when we saw the need for more alignment
between teams. Our OKRs were well crafted, but implementation fell short.
When departments counted on one another for crucial support, we failed to
make the dependency explicit. Coordination was hit-and-miss, with deadlines
blown on a regular basis. We had no shortage of objectives, but our teams kept
wandering away from one another.

The following year, we tried to fix the problem with periodic integration
meetings for the executive team. Each quarter our department heads presented
their goals and identified dependencies. No one left the room until we’d
answered some basic questions: Are we meeting everyone’s needs for buy-in?
Is a team overstretched? If so, how can we make their objectives more
realistic?

Alignment doesn’t mean redundancy. At MyFitnessPal, every OKR has a
single owner, with other teams linking up as needed. As I see it, co-ownership
weakens accountability. If an OKR fails, I don’t want two people blaming each
other. Even when two or more teams have parallel objectives, their key results
should be distinct.

Each time we went through the OKR process, we did a little better. Our
objectives got more precise, our key results more measurable, our achievement
rate higher. It took us two or three quarters to really get the hang of it,
particularly for product features keyed to a broad objective. It’s not easy to
predict the market for the conceptually new; we’d wildly beat our metric or wildly
miss. So we switched it up. We began pinning our key results to deadlines
instead of revenue or projected users. (Example: “Launch MFP Premium by
5/1/15.”) After a feature launched and some real data came back, we’d be in a
stronger position to assess its impact and potential. Then our next round of
OKRs could be more realistically keyed (or stretched) to projected outputs.

At times we’d see our team choosing lower-risk key results, like sending
emails here or push notifications there. The more ambitious the stretch in the
objective, the more conservatively people made their KRs—a classic
unintended consequence. So we learned to design our goals to fit the context.
Where appropriate, we went for the incremental. But there were times when we
told the team, “Don’t worry about monthly active user impact on this one. Just
build the best feature you can. We want you to swing for the fences.”



Unacknowledged Dependencies, Writ Larger
Going with Under Armour meant adapting to a company with a whole different
mode of goal setting. Suddenly I had a boss to align with and a newly formed
division to run: UA Connected Fitness–North America. Our mandate was to
leverage emerging digital technologies to improve fitness and performance. I
had three additional apps to coordinate, each with a different culture and
working style.

At scale, alignment grows exponentially more complex. How would we show
four hundred people what we were trying to achieve, to help them align with us
and with one another? How could we get everybody rowing in the same
direction? In the beginning, I found it really hard to do; I can hardly imagine how
Amazon or Apple manages. When we introduced OKRs throughout our division,
it made a big difference.

A few weeks after our acquisition, my boss called an off-site leadership
meeting for twenty people, including Connected Fitness stakeholders across the
company. Since Under Armour followed an annual cadence, department heads
were to present what they aimed to achieve that year. At MyFitnessPal, we
were accustomed to investing the time to frame our objectives correctly. Our
group was ready.

As the meeting unfolded, Albert and I were surprised to discover that the
ecommerce team was counting on us to drive significant traffic from our apps.
The data team assumed we’d deliver a mass of data. The media sales team
had marked us down for a set dollar amount in new ad revenues. All three had
preconceived notions of what they could expect from us, with no visibility into
what other teams were asking. Nor could anyone see how their targets might
align with our own growth objectives, much less the bigger company picture.
There were unacknowledged dependencies wherever we looked. It was our old
problem at MyFitnessPal, on steroids. There was simply no way we could get all
these things done.

It took eighteen months to straighten out our division’s alignment, and we
couldn’t have done it without OKRs. First, we had to define our capacity
constraints for developing new software. Then we had to clarify our core
priorities. By sharing our high-level OKRs for Connected Fitness, I could explain
why certain projects required the allocated time, and where we should be
doubling down on the company’s top goals. “This is the process we use,” I said,
“and I’m showing you our objectives and key results. You need to let me know if
you see anything missing, or if you think we’re working on the wrong things.”

It was one-way transparency, and I felt a little nervous going in, but it
worked. People began to recognize our limits and adjust their expectations
accordingly. For our part, we worked to align with them by finding projects that
met cross-departmental objectives.

When Albert took hold of our MapMyFitness product team, first he examined
the road map and said, “We need to cut half of this, right? We need to strip it
down to the things that really matter.” Now we evaluate product features the



MyFitnessPal way: “If we take this one off the road map this quarter, what
happens? Would it really affect the user experience?” More often than not, the
feature in question wouldn’t make a big difference. These calls are not
subjective; we have metrics to measure impact. We’re making tougher, sharper
choices about where to place our bets these days, and they all stem from the
OKR process.

Focus and alignment are binary stars. In May 2015, three months after
Under Armour acquired us, our Premium subscription version finally launched. It
couldn’t happen until we openly admitted, “Look, we can’t get all of these things
done. We have to choose.” We had to make it clear to the company that
Premium was our number-one objective, above all else.

We’re still a work in progress. Shortly after the merger, two of our four apps
simultaneously implemented maps inside their run-tracking functions. Because
they’d failed to collaborate in development, they built their maps in different
ways with different providers. Beyond the obvious inefficiency, our customers’
experience would be inconsistent. To their credit, the two teams devised a
monthly check-in to avoid similar problems in the future. Shortly thereafter, we
implemented OKRs throughout the division. Now we’re all on the same page.
Everyone knows our group’s top priorities, which gives them freedom to say no
to other things.

North Star Alignment
Though our start-up days are behind us, we’re still ambitious goal setters. We
still stand by our OKR values of transparency and accountability. We publish
our objectives on a wiki that anybody in the company can see. We discuss them
at weekly all-hands meetings. At a recent off-site retreat, I demonstrated our
OKR process to the larger leadership group—and they just ate it up. “Best off-
site we’ve ever had,” one executive said. With OKRs entrenched as the
operational foundation for Connected Fitness, my hope is to spread them by
example throughout Under Armour. The larger the organization, the more value
the system offers.

Beyond making objectives more consistent within a company, alignment
contains a deeper meaning. It’s about keeping your goals true to your North
Star values. Connected Fitness is deliberately aligned with Under Armour’s
mission “to make all athletes better.” At the same time, we still live by the old
MyFitnessPal mantra: When our customers succeed at reaching their health
and fitness goals, we succeed as a company. As a team, we’re still posing the
question that Albert and I asked each other at the beginning: Will this feature—
or this partnership—help our customers succeed?

After all, it’s our users who do the hard work to change their lives. Like the
woman who rose from her chair without using her hands, for the first time in
twenty years—a poignant moment of clarity. To the extent we’ve succeeded as



a company, it’s in helping to provide those moments. Whenever possible, we
spell this out in our high-level objectives, as you can see in the following OKR
from a few years back:

OBJECTIVE
Help more people around the world.

KEY RESULTS
1. Add 27M new users in 2014.
2. Reach 80M total registered users.

Every decision we make needs to square with our vision. When we face a
trade-off between our customers and a business goal, we align with the
customer. When an objective seems out of line with our mantra, it gets extra
scrutiny. Before moving forward, we make sure it lines up with our North Star.
That’s what keeps us walking the walk and connected with the people we serve.
That’s what makes us who we are.

Connect: The Intuit Story

Atticus Tysen
Chief Information Officer

I ntuit has made Fortune’s prestigious list of the “World’s Most
Admired Companies” for fourteen years running. The firm made
its first splash in the 1980s with Quicken, which brought

personal finance to the desktop computer and became a household
name. Then came tax preparation software (TurboTax) and a
desktop accounting program (QuickBooks), which eventually moved
online. Over its long history, by tech standards, Intuit has survived
one competitive threat after the next by staying a step ahead. Most
recently, it sold Quicken and reconstructed QuickBooks Online as
an open platform. Subscriptions soared by 49 percent. “Whenever
Intuit makes a wrong turn,” UBS analyst Brent Thill told The New
York Times, “they quickly get off the gravel and back onto the
blacktop. That’s why the company has done so well for such a long
time.”

People can’t connect with what they cannot see; networks cannot
blossom in silos. By definition, OKRs are open and visible to all
parts of an organization, to each level of every department. As a
result, companies that stick with them become more coherent.



Intuit CIO Atticus Tysen at Goal Summit, 2017.

Adaptable organizations tend to be more openly connected ones.
Intuit’s culture of transparency was ingrained by cofounder Scott
Cook and strengthened by “Coach” Bill Campbell, who served as
Intuit’s CEO and longtime chairman. “Bill was one of the most open
guys I’ve ever met,” says Atticus Tysen, Intuit’s senior vice president
and chief information officer. “He could read people and he invested
in them. You always knew what he was thinking and that he was in
your corner.”

The Coach’s legacy lives on. A few years ago, to help the IT
department adapt as Intuit moved to the cloud, Atticus introduced
OKRs to his direct reports. The following quarter, he rolled the
system down to the director level; the quarter after that, to all six
hundred IT employees. He was determined not to force the new



process. “We didn’t want bureaucratic compliance,” Atticus says.
“We wanted enthusiastic compliance. I wanted to see if the OKR
system would succeed on its own—and it really did.”

Each quarter, Intuit’s IT group tackles about 2,500 active
objectives. As they’ve built their goal-setting muscle with real-time,
automated data and routine check-ins, users align roughly half of
their OKRs with the goals of higher-ups or their department.
Collectively, they view their managers’ OKRs more than four
thousand times per quarter, or seven views per employee—a strong
marker of frontline engagement. After the Lasik surgery of OKRs,
contributors see clearer links between their own day-to-day work,
their colleagues’ priorities, their team’s quarterly objectives, and the
company’s “True North” mission.

Intuit’s story demonstrates the benefits of an OKR pilot project
before (or even without) a full-company rollout. A few hundred
users may suffice for an OKR laboratory, to iron out any kinks
before deployment at scale. At Intuit, says CEO Brad Smith, who
posts his own goals in his office for anyone to see, connected goal
setting “is critical to enabling employees to do the best work of their
lives.”

—
Atticus Tysen: I’d been working at Intuit for eleven years on the product side
before moving to the IT department. Then, in 2013, I became CIO. I made the
switch because I loved the company, and I knew IT needed to evolve to help
Intuit on its new mission. It was a stressful, exciting time. The organization was
pivoting in several directions at once: from desktop software to cloud-based
software, from a closed platform to one that was open to thousands of third-
party apps, from a North American company to a global company. As we leaned
into our long-term strategy to become an integrated ecosystem, we gradually
changed from a house of brands (TurboTax, Quicken, QuickBooks) to the
branded house of Intuit.

In the storm of any disruption, IT will bear the brunt of in-house frustrations.
Partly it’s because the operation tends to be opaque. Any thirty-plus-year-old
company accumulates layers of complex technology—especially a technology
company. In IT, we’re always juggling the needs of internal partners with the
demands of our end users. We bridge technology and business outcomes.
Maybe toughest of all, we must balance the task of making systems work
perfectly today (as our people expect) with our mandate to invest in the future.
For example: Intuit used to have nine different billing systems to serve our array
of products, and each of them had special challenges. When you’re putting out
fires every day, it’s hard to build a next-generation billing technology.



How could we signal to our workforce what mattered most while keeping
them all up and running? And how could we assure all hands that we had their
concerns covered? In a conventionally siloed organization, activity is opaque.
People might try to look into what’s going on outside their own department, but
they often don’t know where to start or have the time to follow up.

At Intuit, change started at the top. To jump-start our transformation, our
chairman and CEO, Brad Smith, installed a company-wide goal-setting system.
Brad is very conscious and intentional about this. Once each month, managers
meet with their reports to discuss individual goals. The system has built-in, 360-
degree feedback, with both parties comparing notes on a regular basis.

Our company has a long cultural history around learning and
experimentation. We try a lot of things, keep the elements that work best, and
adapt them to make them our own. I agreed to partner with HR to try OKRs in
Enterprise Business Solutions, or EBS (our moniker for IT). Back in 2014, I first
discovered objectives and key results while Googling “goal setting.” My
research suggested that OKRs might help us change the way we operate, even
how we perceive ourselves.

Modern IT goes way beyond checking off boxes to process help tickets or
change requests. It’s about adding value to the business—shedding redundant
clone systems, creating new functionality, finding future-oriented solutions. To
become the team Intuit needed, our EBS would need to change root and
branch. Our leaders had to give people air cover to back-burner some day-to-
day tasks and focus on more valuable, longer-term initiatives.

Today, every employee in my department owns three to five business
objectives per quarter, along with one or two personal ones. The system is
powerful precisely because it is so simple—and so transparent. For our OKRs
to be effective, I knew they’d have to be visible through all of Intuit, even if no
one outside EBS used them. I wanted everyone in the company to know exactly
what we were doing, and how, and why. When people understand your
priorities and constraints, they’re more apt to trust you when something goes
sideways.

Early on, I found it challenging to separate my individual goals from the
department’s OKRs. As IT’s leader, I thought they should logically coincide. But
it wasn’t a good optic. Most of our top-level objectives endured from quarter to
quarter, typically for eighteen months. Down the line, teams and individuals
would modify their own OKRs as the environment shifted and we kept making
progress. And they were asking, quite reasonably, “What is the CIO doing if his
goals never change?” I got the message. Now I have my own objectives, and I
ladder up to our top-level OKRs like everyone else.

Beyond our base in the Bay Area, we made it a point to implement the
system worldwide. EBS has formal teams in four U.S. regions and in Bangalore,
the high-tech center of southern India, plus support teams in every Intuit
location around the globe. When people work outside the center, they’re left to
wonder what gets done at headquarters. (And headquarters may wonder about
them, too.) OKRs ended the mystery. They made us more cohesive; they
brought us together.



One of our top-level EBS objectives is to “rationalize, modernize, and secure
all technology used to run Intuit.” (See here.) Lately, whenever I travel to see a
team in Texas or Arizona, I hear our people saying, “This project is rationalizing
our portfolio.” Or: “How can we modernize that system?” No matter where they
happen to be stationed, they’re using the same three verbs. When a new
project comes up for discussion, they’ll ask one another how it fits into our OKR
template. If it doesn’t, they’ll rightly raise a red flag: “Why are we doing this?”

OBJECTIVE
Modernize, rationalize, and secure the technology used to

run the business of Intuit.

KEY RESULTS
1. Complete migration of Oracle eBusiness Suite to R12

and retire 11.5.9 this quarter.
2. Deliver wholesale billing as a platform capability by end

FY16.
3. Complete onboarding of agents in small business unit

to Salesforce.
4. Create a retirement plan for all legacy technology.
5. Draft and get alignment on new Workforce Technology

strategies, road maps, and principles.

Live Data from the Cloud
Intuit views itself as a thirty-four-year-old start-up. Beginning with the personal
computer in the 1980s, our history reflects a series of tech disruptions, with
each new platform upending its predecessor. Our first product was on DOS.
Then we moved to Windows and Macintosh on the desktop, then to mobile
devices, and most recently to the cloud.

OKRs can be deployed to even greater effect in the cloud era. Horizontal
alignment comes naturally. With open, public goal setting, the data and
analytics team could see from the start what our financial systems team had in
mind. It was immediately obvious that they should be working together, in
parallel. The teams linked up their objectives in real time, rather than after the
fact—a sea change from our historical way of doing things.

At a desktop software company, leaders look at operations through a
twentieth-century retail lens. They postmortem sales reports and channel flow.



While they do their best to predict where the business might be headed, their
line of sight is largely limited to the rearview mirror. By contrast, a cloud-based
business wants to know what is happening now. How many subscriptions came
in this week? How many trials are ongoing? What’s our conversion rate? A
customer can Google an online product, skim the marketing page, take it for a
spin, and make a purchase—all in ten minutes or less. For leaders to keep
pace, they should be checking their funnel on a daily basis. At EBS, we need to
be thinking about real-time reporting, data, and analytics, even as we build out
features like wholesale billing. We’ve captured this necessity in a top-level
objective:

OBJECTIVE
Enable every Intuit worker to make decisions based on

“live” data.

KEY RESULTS
1. Deliver functional data marts for HR and Sales.
2. Complete migration to new Enterprise Data Warehouse

built for real-time access.
3. Create single team operating all data visualization tools

across Intuit to drive a unified strategy.
4. Create teaching module to help people in other teams

use data visualization tools.

A Tool for Global Collaboration
As Intuit becomes more global, asynchronous collaboration is increasingly a
way of life. When we’re working from headquarters with our team in Bangalore,
live video has limited utility. Given the thirteen-hour time difference, our
associates in India will be sleeping when we’re working, and vice versa. Three
years ago, there were few practical options. Intuit invested in the latest
workplace tools, but we lacked solutions for persistent chat, collaborative
authoring, and videoconferencing. People were forced to improvise, with
uneven results. Productivity slipped.

To attack the problem in a more connected way, we upgraded a key result
for workforce technology to its own top-level OKR. In the space of six months,
our new strategic emphasis led us to add several new tools, all integrated into a
single authentication system: Slack for persistent chat, Google Docs for
collaborative editing, Box for content management, BlueJeans for next-wave
video technology. Our open OKR platform helped teams across EBS to make



the transition and align with our new top-line objective. Now our people can
focus on their work instead of wasting time to figure out which tool to use.

There’s an art to goal setting, and more than a few judgment calls. If you
choose to temporarily elevate a key result, it helps to be candid about it.
Leaders need to explain, “Yes, I want us to focus on that one right now as a top-
level objective. When it no longer needs the extra attention, we’ll let it drift back
down into a KR.” It’s a dynamic system. You’re always adjusting the altitude.

—

OBJECTIVE
Deliver awesome end-to-end workforce technology

solutions and strategies.

KEY RESULTS
1. Implement Box pilot for first 100 users by mid-quarter.
2. Complete BlueJeans rollout to final users by end of the

quarter.
3. Transfer first 50 individual account Google users to

enterprise account by end of the quarter.
4. Finalize Slack contract by end of month 1 and complete

rollout play by end of the quarter.

Studies have told us forever that frontline employees thrive when they can

see how their work aligns to the company’s overall goals. I’ve found this
especially true at our remote sites. I’ve heard it from people in Bangalore: “My
objective is directly a key result of my manager’s OKR, which ties directly to the
top-level EBS objective, which ties to the company’s shift to the cloud. Now I
understand how what I’m doing in India connects to the company mission.”
That’s a powerful realization. OKRs have consolidated our far-flung department.
Thanks to structured, visible goal setting, our boundaries have melted away.

Horizontal Connections
Intuit was a flat organization from the start, with just a handful of tiers between
the CEO and frontline employees. Our founder, Scott Cook, believed the best
idea should win, not the biggest title, and that still holds true today. From the
day I came in as a group manager, I was impressed by the collaborative culture.
Even when we ran things in silos, we were vertically open. You could always



speak freely to your manager, or your manager’s manager, and get a respectful
hearing.

OKRs have opened our department horizontally, across teams. At first it was
awkward. Everybody in IT instinctively wanted to align with their managers’
goals—or with mine. I went into the platform one day and found literally
hundreds of key results linked to one of my top-level objectives. I told people,
“Your manager is still your manager. You’ll continue to collaborate—none of
that’s going to change. But you need to disconnect from us and connect to each
other.”

Our ecommerce and billing teams work under separate vice presidents who
roll up to me. If ecommerce is building a shopping cart, billing needs to bring
related features to market. In the old way, the two engineering teams ran
independently and reported to their respective program managers, who tried
(with variable success) to connect from above. The people doing the actual
work had no direct contact.

Now, with horizontally transparent OKRs, our engineers intentionally connect
as they link to each other’s objectives. Quarter by quarter, they iterate against
the department’s objectives while devising how best to coordinate with their
peers. We’re trending away from senior committee mandates and toward real
autonomy. Our EBS leaders still set the context, ask the big questions, and
furnish relevant data. But it’s our interconnected groups whose insights are
propelling us forward—together.

Superpower #3: Track for
Accountability

In God we trust; all others must bring data.
—W. Edwards Deming

O ne underrated virtue of OKRs is that they can be tracked—
and then revised or adapted as circumstances dictate.
Unlike traditional, frozen, “set them and forget them”

business goals, OKRs are living, breathing organisms. Their life
cycle unfolds in three phases, which I’ll consider in turn.

The Setup

While general-purpose software can get an OKR process up and
running, there’s a catch: It doesn’t scale. When one Fortune 500
company recently tried to ramp up its goal-setting cadence, it hit a
wall. All of its 82,000 contributors had dutifully recorded their
annual objectives in Microsoft Word files! A move to quarterly
OKRs would have generated 328,000 files per year. They’d all be
public, in theory, but who would have the patience to search out
connections or alignment? If you share a goal that nobody sees, is
the system truly transparent?

In 2014, when Bill Pence came to AOL as global chief technology
officer, top-line company and division goals were presented on a
spreadsheet and rolled down from there. “But they never really had
a home, where they connected on a daily basis with people,” Pence
says. Without frequent status updates, goals slide into irrelevance;



the gap between plan and reality widens by the day. At quarter’s end
(or worse, year’s end), we’re left with zombie OKRs, on-paper whats
and hows devoid of life or meaning.

Contributors are most engaged when they can actually see how
their work contributes to the company’s success. Quarter to quarter,
day to day, they look for tangible measures of their achievement.
Extrinsic rewards—the year-end bonus check—merely validate what
they already know. OKRs speak to something more powerful, the
intrinsic value of the work itself.

As the bar for structured goal setting rises, more organizations
are adopting robust, dedicated, cloud-based OKR management
software. The best-in-class platforms feature mobile apps,
automatic updating, analytics reporting tools, real-time alerts, and
integration with Salesforce, JIRA, and Zendesk. With three or four
clicks, users can navigate a digital dashboard to create, track, edit,
and score their OKRs. These platforms deliver transformative OKR
values:

They make everyone’s goals more visible. Users gain
seamless access to OKRs for their boss, their direct reports,
and the organization at large.
They drive engagement. When you know you’re working
on the right things, it’s easier to stay motivated.

They promote internal networking. A transparent platform
steers individuals to colleagues with shared professional
interests.
They save time, money, and frustration. In conventional
goal setting, hours are wasted digging for documentation in
meeting notes, emails, Word documents, and PowerPoint
slides. With an OKR management platform, all relevant
information is ready when you are.

At AOL, CEO Tim Armstrong felt the company’s goals were “too
disconnected,” Bill Pence recalls. “They weren’t linked together;
they didn’t cascade up and down. They just didn’t stay tethered to
the employees and the work they were doing through the year.” In
2016, Armstrong brought in a dedicated platform and rolled out
OKRs. The upshot, Pence says, was radical transparency, real-time



connection, and a company that coordinated operations as a matter
of course.

OKR Shepherd

For an OKR system to function effectively, the team deploying it—
whether a group of top executives or an entire organization—must
adopt it universally. No exceptions, no opt-outs. Yes, there will be
late adopters, resisters, and garden-variety procrastinators. To prod
them to join the flock, a best practice is to designate one or more
OKR shepherds. For years, that role in Google’s products
department was filled by senior vice president Jonathan Rosenberg.
Here is one of Jonathan’s classic communiqués, with the laggards’
names deleted to protect the guilty:

From: Jonathan Rosenberg
Date: Thu, Aug 5, 2010 at 2:59 PM
Subject: Amidst boundless opportunities, 13 PMs whiff on OKRs (names
included)

Product Gang,
As most of you know, I strongly believe that having a good set of quarterly
OKRs is an important part of being successful at Google. That’s why I
regularly send you notes reminding you to get them done on time, and why I
ask managers to review them to make sure all of our OKRs are good. I’ve
tried notes that are nice and notes that are mean. Personal favorites include
threatening you with Jonathan’s Pit of Despair in October 07 and celebrating
near perfection in July 08. Over time I iterated this carrot/stick approach until
we reached near 100% compliance. Yay!
So then I stopped sending notes, and look what happened: this quarter,
SEVERAL of you didn’t get your OKRs done on time, and several others
didn’t grade your Q2 OKRs. It turns out it’s not the type of note I send that
matters, but the fact that I send anything at all! Names of the fallen are duly
noted below (with a pass given to several AdMob employees who are new to
the ways of Google, and to many of you who missed the deadline but still got
them done in July).
We have so many great opportunities before us (search, ads, display,
YouTube, Android, enterprise, local, commerce, Chrome, TV, mobile,
social . . .) that if you can’t come up with OKRs that get you excited about
coming to work every day, then something must be wrong. In fact, if that’s
really the case, come see me.
In the meantime, please do your OKRs on time, grade your previous quarter’s
OKRs, do a good job at it, and post them so that the OKR link from your



moma [intranet] page works. This is not administrative busywork, it’s an
important way to set your priorities for the quarter and ensure that we’re all
working together.
Jonathan

Midlife Tracking

As the Fitbit craze attests, people crave to know how they’re
progressing and see it visually represented, down to the percentage
point. Research suggests that making measured headway can be
more incentivizing than public recognition, monetary inducements,
or even achieving the goal itself. Daniel Pink, the author of Drive,
agrees: “The single greatest motivator is ‘making progress in one’s
work.’ The days that people make progress are the days they feel
most motivated and engaged.”

Most goal management platforms use visual aids to show
progress toward objectives and key results. Unlike steps on Fitbit,
OKRs don’t require daily tracking. But regular check-ins—
preferably weekly—are essential to prevent slippage. As Peter
Drucker observed, “Without an action plan, the executive becomes a
prisoner of events. And without check-ins to reexamine the plan as
events unfold, the executive has no way of knowing which events
really matter and which are only noise.”

As noted in chapter 4, the simple act of writing down a goal
increases your chances of reaching it. Your odds are better still if
you monitor progress while sharing the goal with colleagues—two
integral OKR features. In one California study, people who recorded
their goals and sent weekly progress reports to a friend attained 43
percent more of their objectives than those who merely thought
about goals without sharing them.

—
OKRs are adaptable by nature. They’re meant to be guardrails, not
chains or blinders. As we track and audit our OKRs, we have four
options at any point in the cycle:

Continue: If a green zone (“on track”) goal isn’t broken,
don’t fix it.



Update: Modify a yellow zone (“needs attention”) key result
or objective to respond to changes in the workflow or
external environment. What could be done differently to
get the goal on track? Does it need a revised time line? Do
we back-burner other initiatives to free up resources for
this one?

Start: Launch a new OKR mid-cycle, whenever the need
arises.
Stop: When a red zone (“at risk”) goal has outlived its
usefulness, the best solution may be to drop it.*

The point of a real-time dashboard is to quantify progress against
a target and flag what needs attention. While OKRs are primarily a
positive force for more, they also stop us from persisting in the
wrong direction. As Stephen Covey noted, “If the ladder is not
leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the
wrong place faster.” Late-in-game surprises are less likely when you
track your OKRs for continuous feedback. Good news or bad, reality
intrudes. In the process, “people can learn from failure and move
on, perhaps turning some aspect of the setback into the seedling of a
new success.”

When Remind’s school-messaging platform prototyped the
company’s first revenue-yielding service, a peer-to-peer payment
system, it was a total flop. “No one used it,” says Brett Kopf. “It
didn’t solve a clear problem. We immediately altered the goal to
build an event-driven system, where the teacher could say, ‘I’ve got
a field trip next week. Are you coming, yes or no? And do you want
to pay?’ That changed everything. It started driving and growing like
crazy.”

Whenever a key result or objective becomes obsolete or
impractical, feel free to end it midstream. There’s no need to hold
stubbornly to an outdated projection—strike it from your list and
move on. Our goals are servants to our purpose, not the other way
around.

One proviso: When an objective gets dropped before the end of
the OKR interval, it’s important to notify everyone depending on it.
Then comes reflection: What did I learn that I didn’t foresee at the
beginning of the quarter? And: How will I apply this lesson in the
future?



For best results, OKRs are scrutinized several times per quarter
by contributors and their managers. Progress is reported, obstacles
identified, key results refined. On top of these one-on-ones, teams
and departments hold regular meetings to evaluate progress toward
shared objectives. Whenever a committed OKR is failing, a rescue
plan is devised. At Google, the frequency of team check-ins varies
with the business needs of the moment, the gap between predicted
outcomes and execution, the quality of intragroup communication,
and the group’s size and location(s). The more dispersed the team’s
members, the more frequently they touch base. Google’s benchmark
check-in cycle is monthly, at a minimum, though goal discussions
there are so pervasive that formal meetings sometimes go by the
boards.

Wrap-up: Rinse and Repeat

OKRs do not expire with completion of the work. As in any data-
driven system, tremendous value can be gained from post hoc
evaluation and analysis. In both one-on-ones and team meetings,
these wrap-ups consist of three parts: objective scoring, subjective
self-assessment, and reflection.

Scoring

In scoring our OKRs, we mark what we’ve achieved and address
how we might do it differently next time. A low score forces
reassessment: Is the objective still worth pursuing? If so, what can
we change to achieve it?

On state-of-the-art goal management platforms, OKR scores are
system-generated; the numbers are objective, untouched by human
hands. (With less automated, homegrown platforms, users may
need to perform their own calculations.) The simplest, cleanest way
to score an objective is by averaging the percentage completion
rates of its associated key results. Google uses a scale of 0 to 1.0:

0.7 to 1.0 = green.* (We delivered.)



0.4 to 0.6 = yellow. (We made progress, but fell short of
completion.)

0.0 to 0.3 = red. (We failed to make real progress.)
Intel followed a similar formula. You may recall the OKR for

Operation Crush, the company’s push to reclaim the microprocessor
market. Here are Andy Grove’s actual marching orders from Q2
1980, as endorsed by his executive team (with end-of-quarter
grades in brackets):

CORPORATE OBJECTIVE
Establish the 8086 as the highest-performance 16-bit microprocessor family, as

measured by:

KEY RESULTS (Q2 1980)
1. Develop and publish five benchmarks showing superior

8086 family performance [0.6].
2. Repackage the entire 8086 family of products [1.0].
3. Get the 8MHz part into production [0].
4. Sample the arithmetic coprocessor no later than June

15 [0.9].

And here is how these scores were determined:

We completed three of five benchmarks for an 0.6, a
borderline green.
We did indeed repackage the 8086 family, under a new
product line called iAPX. So that’s a perfect 1.0.

Production of the 8MHz part, set for early May, was a
fiasco.* Because of problems with the polysilicon, the target
had to be pushed to October. That’s a zero.

As for the arithmetic coprocessor, the goal was to ship 500
parts by June 15. We wound up shipping 470—which
computes to 0.9, another green.

Altogether, we averaged 62.5 percent (or a raw score of 0.625) on
our KRs for this objective, a respectable grade. The Intel board
judged it below expectations but not too far below, because they



knew how aggressively management set our goals. As a rule, we’d
enter a quarter knowing we wouldn’t achieve all of them. If a
department so much as approached 100 percent, it was presumed to
be setting its sights too low—and there would be hell to pay.

Self-assessment

In evaluating OKR performance, objective data is enhanced by the
goal setter’s thoughtful, subjective judgment. For any given goal in a
given quarter, there may be extenuating circumstances. A weak
showing by the numbers might hide a strong effort; a strong one
could be artificially inflated.

Say the team’s objective is to recruit new customers, and your
individual key result is fifty phone calls. You wind up calling thirty-
five prospects, for a raw goal score of 70 percent. Did you succeed or
fail? By itself, the data doesn’t afford us much insight. But if a dozen
of your calls lasted several hours apiece and resulted in eight new
customers, you might give yourself a perfect 1.0. Conversely: If you
procrastinated, rushed through all fifty calls, and signed only one
new customer, you might assess your performance at 0.25—because
you could have pushed harder. (And on reflection: Should the key
result have prioritized new customers, rather than calls?)

Or say you’re a public relations manager, and your team’s key
result is to place three national articles about your company.
Though you get only two pieces published, one is a cover story in
The Wall Street Journal. Your raw score is 67 percent, but you say,
“I’m giving us a 9 out of 10, because we hit that one out of the park.”

Googlers are encouraged to use their OKRs in self-assessments—
as guides, not as grades. As Shona Brown, former SVP of business
operations, explained it to me, “It wasn’t that they got a red or
yellow or green, but here was a list of what they’d delivered on that
was above business as usual and connected to the overall goals of
the company.” The point of objectives and key results, after all, is to
get everyone working on the right things.

Table 10.1: Scoring and Assessment Variations
OKR Progress Score Self-assessment



Bring in ten new 70% 0.9 Due to a slump in the market, the OKR was
customers. significantly tougher to achieve than I’d thought.

Our seven new customers represented an
exceptionally good effort and outcome.

Bring in ten new 100% 0.7 When I reached the objective only eight weeks
customers. into the quarter, I realized I’d set the OKR too low.
Bring in ten new 80% 0.6 While I signed eight new customers, it was more
customers. luck than hard work. One customer brought in five

others behind her.
Bring in ten new 90% 0.5 Though I managed to land nine new customers, I
customers. discovered that seven would bring in little

revenue.

Invariably, some people will grade themselves too harshly; others
may need to be challenged. In either case, an alert facilitator or
team leader will jump in and help recalibrate. In the end, the
numbers are probably less important than contextual feedback and
a broader discussion within the team.

Where OKR scores pinpoint what went right or wrong in the
work, and how the team might improve, self-assessments drive a
superior goal-setting process for the next quarter. There are no
judgments, only learnings.

Reflection

OKRs are inherently action oriented. But when action is relentless
and unceasing, it can be a hamster wheel of grim striving. In my
view, the key to satisfaction is to set aggressive goals, achieve most
of them, pause to reflect on the achievement, and then repeat the
cycle. Learning “from direct experience,” a Harvard Business School
study found, “can be more effective if coupled with reflection—that
is, the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the
key lessons taught by experience.” The philosopher and educator
John Dewey went a step further: “We do not learn from
experience . . . we learn from reflecting on experience.”

Here are some reflections for closing out an OKR cycle:
Did I accomplish all of my objectives? If so, what
contributed to my success?



If not, what obstacles did I encounter?

If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I
change?
What have I learned that might alter my approach to the
next cycle’s OKRs?

OKR wrap-ups are retrospective and forward-looking at the same
time. An unfinished objective might be rolled over to the next
quarter, with a fresh set of key results—or perhaps its moment has
passed, and it is appropriately dropped. Either way, sound
management judgment comes first.

And one more thing. After thoroughly appraising your work and
owning up to any shortfalls, take a breath to savor your progress.
Throw a party with the team to celebrate your growing OKR
superpowers. You’ve earned it.

Track: The Gates Foundation Story

Bill Gates
Cochairman

Patty Stonesifer
Former CEO

I n 2000, the newly hatched Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
became something the world had never seen: a $20 billion start-
up. Though Bill Gates had recently stepped down as CEO of

Microsoft, he was still the company’s chairman and chief product
strategist. He had to find a way to channel the foundation’s vast
ambition, adapt to fluid conditions in the field, and allow himself—
the extremely busy, famously fast-moving founder—to make the
best possible choices. The higher the stakes, the more important it is
to track progress—to flag looming problems, double back from dead
ends, and modify goals on the run.

The newborn institution had signed on for the most audacious
mission imaginable: “Everyone deserves a healthy and productive
life.” So its leaders enlisted scores of brilliant people who’d devoted
their lives to global health and told them, “Quit thinking about
incremental progress. What would you do if you had unlimited
resources?”

By 2002, the foundation had scaled to the point where it urgently
required a more structured form of goal setting. After CEO Patty
Stonesifer heard my OKR pitch at an Amazon board meeting, she
asked me to present it to the foundation. The rest is OKR history.

—



Patty Stonesifer: We had the beautiful gift of a blank sheet of paper: “How do
you want to change the world?” But the gift also had a huge weight to it.
Because when you have that big of a goal, how can you know you’re making
progress?

Melinda Gates, Patty Stonesifer, and Bill Gates reviewing OKRs, 2005.

We felt driven to be responsible with the capital. Bill and Melinda wanted to
know that a disciplined system was in place to direct our hard choices. We
borrowed from Jim Collins: “What can you be the best at in the world?” Once we
figured that out, we laid the OKR system on top of it. We believed that everyone
should have a healthy and productive life, and Bill and Melinda were passionate
about the role of technology in creating change. That was in our DNA.

For a time we used a global health metric called Disability-Adjusted Life
Years, or DALY. It gave us a data-driven framework for key results—say, to
measure the impact of an investment in micronutrients against one to fight river
blindness. DALY led us to focus on vaccines, which make such an enormous
difference in productive life years. Now we had a credible metric, reinforced by
our key results. OKRs made it all so clear.

—
Bill Gates: Ambitious, directional goals were always super-important at
Microsoft. It was natural, in a way, because from a very young age I thought
software was magic. In those early days, the exponential increase in transistors



actually mapped to the performance of the device. We understood what the
chips people were going to give us and that there was no end in sight, and that
the storage and communication people likewise were writing exponential code.
The screen people weren’t quite as exponential, but the graphical user interface
would be fast enough. There was only one missing element: the magic software
to make the device do something interesting. I gave up on being a lawyer or a
scientist, surefire things, because the idea of what would happen with all that
intelligence—what I called “information at your fingertips”—was just so
fascinating. It was mind-blowing to me.

Even before Paul Allen and I started the partnership, we were saying: A
computer on every desk and in every home. IBM and other people—with
resources and skill sets way beyond ours—weren’t aiming for that goal. They
didn’t see it as a possibility, so they weren’t pushing as hard to make it a reality.
But we could see that it would happen. Moore’s law would make things cheaper
and get the software industry to critical mass. Those were big, big goals, and
they started early for us.

That was our biggest advantage: We aimed higher.

Making Goals Concrete
In the year 2000, Melinda and I put $20 billion into the Gates Foundation.
Suddenly it’s both a start-up and the biggest foundation in the world. And the
way the payout rules work, it has to spend a minimum of a billion dollars a year.

2000.

I’d watched Andy Grove manage people on subgoals [key results], and I
watched the Japanese, and I learned how you deal with things when people fall
short. I don’t think I invented anything there, but I did watch and learn. Then
Patty Stonesifer brought in OKRs, the green-yellow-red approach, and it
worked. When we used OKRs with our grant reviews, I felt good about what we
were going after. I was still running Microsoft, and my time was limited, and
Patty had to make things very efficient between us, to make sure we agreed.
The goals process was a big part of that. There were two cases where I turned
down a grant in the end because the goals weren’t clear enough. The OKR
system made me confident I was making the right call.

I’m a huge fan of goals, but they need to be handled correctly. At one point,
the malaria team thought we’d eradicate the disease by 2015, which wasn’t
realistic. When a goal is too aspirational, it’s bad for credibility. In philanthropy, I
see people confusing objectives with missions all the time. A mission is
directional. An objective has a set of concrete steps that you’re intentionally
engaged in and actually trying to go for. It’s fine to have an ambitious objective,
but how do you scale it? How do you measure it?

I think it’s getting better, though. Philanthropy is bringing in more people from
high-performance business environments, and they’re tilting the culture. Having
a good mission is not enough. You need a concrete objective, and you need to
know how you’re going to get there.

—
Patti Stonesifer: OKRs allowed us to be ambitious and disciplined at the same
time. When measurable key results revealed a lack of progress or showed that
an objective was unachievable, we reallocated the capital. If the goal was to
eliminate Guinea worm disease, a very ambitious top-line goal, it was important
to know whether the dollars and resources were making progress against it.
With OKRs, we could set both quarterly and annual beats for substantial key
results against such a huge objective.*

Until you set a really big goal, like vaccinating every child everywhere, you
can’t find out which lever or mix of levers is most important. Our annual strategy
reviews began with: “What is the objective here? Is it eradication or is it
expanding the reach of vaccines?” Then we could get more practical with our
key results—like the 80/90 rule at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization, where 80 percent of districts would have 90 percent or more
coverage. You need those key results to align your everyday activities, and over
time you keep moving them to be even more ambitious against that really big
goal.

Sometimes, to be honest, we were probably measuring the wrong thing. But
the effort was always there to hold ourselves accountable. At private
foundations, where you lack a market effect to gauge impact, you have to pay
close attention to whether your data is getting you to the ultimate goal. We were



learning so fast that sometimes we had to change data sets midstream. Say
you had a seed that would double production of yams, and you were focused on
that number. But then it turned out that nobody would use the seed because the
yams took four times longer to cook at night. . . .

Setting the big goals wasn’t as hard as breaking them down: What rocks
need to be moved to achieve them? That’s one of the beauties of working with
Bill and Melinda. They want to see progress, but bold goals don’t faze them.

—
Case in point: the ongoing fight against the most lethal animal on
the planet, the mosquito.* In 2016, the Gates Foundation teamed
with the British government in a five-year, $4.3 billion campaign to
eradicate malaria, the deadliest of all tropical diseases. Driven by
empirical data, they have broadened their focus from a
transmission-blocking vaccine to a comprehensive eradication
strategy.

OBJECTIVE
Global eradication of malaria by 2040.

KEY RESULTS
1. Prove to the world that a radical cure-based approach

can lead to regional elimination.
2. Prepare for scale-up by creating the necessary tools—

SERCAP (Single Exposure Radical Cure and
Prophylaxis) Diagnostic.

3. Sustain current global progress to ensure the
environment is conducive to eradication push.

The top-line objective is to eliminate the Plasmodium parasite
from the human population, with a special emphasis on drug-
resistant strains. As Bill Gates himself has acknowledged, this effort
won’t be easy. But it has a real chance to succeed because his team is
tracking what matters.

Superpower #4: Stretch for
Amazing

The biggest risk of all is not taking one.
—Mellody Hobson

OKRs push us far beyond our comfort zones. They lead us to
achievements on the border between abilities and dreams.
They unearth fresh capacity, hatch more creative solutions,

revolutionize business models. For companies seeking to live long
and prosper, stretching to new heights is compulsory. As Bill
Campbell liked to say: If companies “don’t continue to innovate,
they’re going to die—and I didn’t say iterate, I said innovate.”
Conservative goal setting stymies innovation. And innovation is like
oxygen: You cannot win without it.

When stretch goals are chosen wisely, the payoff merits the risk
and then some. “Big Hairy Audacious Goals”—Jim Collins’s
memorable phrase in Good to Great—spark leaps to new levels:

A BHAG is a huge and daunting goal—like a big mountain to climb. It is
clear, compelling, and people “get it” right away. A BHAG serves as a
unifying focal point of effort, galvanizing people and creating team spirit
as people strive toward a finish line. Like the 1960s NASA moon mission,
a BHAG captures the imagination and grabs people in the gut.

Edwin Locke, the patriarch of structured goal setting, mined a
dozen studies for a quantitative correlation between goal difficulty
and achievement. The arenas ranged widely, but the results were
“unequivocal,” Locke wrote. “[T]he harder the goal the higher the
level of performance. . . . Although subjects with very hard goals



reached their goals far less often than subjects with very easy goals,
the former consistently performed at a higher level than the latter.”
The studies found that “stretched” workers were not only more
productive, but more motivated and engaged: “Setting specific
challenging goals is also a means of enhancing task interest and of
helping people to discover the pleasurable aspects of an activity.”

In 2007, the National Academy of Engineering asked a panel of
leading thinkers—including Larry Page, futurist Ray Kurzweil, and
geneticist J. Craig Venter—to choose fourteen “Grand Engineering
Challenges” for the twenty-first century. After a year of debate, the
panel settled on an array of quintessential stretch goals: Generate
energy from fusion. Reverse-engineer the brain. Prevent nuclear
terror. Secure cyberspace. (You get the picture.)

Not all stretch goals are so rarefied. Sometimes they represent
“ordinary” work at an extraordinary level. But regardless of scope or
scale, they fit my favorite definition of entrepreneurs:

Those who do more than anyone thinks possible . . . with less
than anyone thinks possible.*

At fledgling start-ups and market leaders alike, stretch goals can
sharpen an entrepreneurial culture. By pushing people past old
limits, they are forces for operating excellence. As Philip Potloff,
chief digital officer at Edmunds.com, noted, “We’re trying to change
the way automotive retailing is conducted, and that’s a massive
challenge and a massive opportunity. The only way for us to boil
down our crazy, big, ‘change-the-industry’ goals is through OKRs.
It’s why OKRs continue to be at the center of what we do.”

Aspirational goals draw on every OKR superpower. Focus and
commitment are a must for targeting goals that make a real
difference. Only a transparent, collaborative, aligned, and
connected organization can achieve so far beyond the norm. And
without quantifiable tracking, how can you know when you’ve
reached that amazing stretch objective?

Two OKR Baskets
Google divides its OKRs into two categories, committed goals and aspirational
(or “stretch”) goals. It’s a distinction with a real difference.

Committed objectives are tied to Google’s metrics: product releases,
bookings, hiring, customers. Management sets them at the company level,
employees at the departmental level. In general, these committed objectives—



such as sales and revenue goals—are to be achieved in full (100 percent)
within a set time frame.

Aspirational objectives reflect bigger-picture, higher-risk, more future-tilting
ideas. They originate from any tier and aim to mobilize the entire organization.
By definition, they are challenging to achieve. Failures—at an average rate of
40 percent—are part of Google’s territory.

The relative weighting of these two baskets is a cultural question. It will
vary from one organization to the next, and from quarter to quarter. Leaders
must ask themselves: What type of company do we need to be in the coming
year? Agile and daring, to crack a new market—or more conservative and
operational, to firm up our existing position? Are we in survival mode, or is
there cash on hand to bet big for a big reward? What does our business
require, right now?

Our Need to Stretch

Andy Grove was a fan of Abraham Maslow, the mid-twentieth-
century psychologist best known for his “hierarchy of needs.”
According to Maslow, only after we satisfy more basic concerns—
starting with food and shelter, then safety, then “love” and
“belongingness”—can we move to higher-level motivations. At the
top of Maslow’s pyramid stands the need for “self-actualization”:

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs represented as a pyramid, with more basic needs
at the base.

Grove was fascinated to find that some people, with no
prompting, were consistently driven to “try to test the outer limits of
their abilities” and achieve their “personal best.” These employees



were a manager’s dream; they were never self-satisfied. But Grove
also understood that not everyone was a natural-born achiever. For
the rest, “stretched” goals could elicit maximum output: “Such goal-
setting is extremely important if you want peak performance from
yourself and your subordinates.”

Intel treasured calculated risk takers. It was the place I learned to
stretch and to dare to fail. In Operation Crush, the do-or-die
campaign to dominate the 16-bit chip microprocessor market, the
company’s salespeople were measured by design wins, the number
of products designed around our 8086 microprocessor. Led by Bill
Davidow, the Crush task force set one of the bolder goals I’ve ever
seen: one thousand design wins in a single calendar year, 50 percent
more than sales had logged the year before. Here is what happened
next, as recalled by Dave House, general manager for
microprocessors:

This is Intel; you’ve got to measure it. And I think it was [Jim] Lally who
said, we need 1,000 design wins. It was a number; it was either Bill or
Jim. . . . And it seemed like an enormous number. And then as we were
developing our plans, somehow that number got changed to 2,000. And
that wound up being the number we would take to field sales.

Two thousand design wins equated to one win per salesperson
per month. Management was asking our field reps to triple their
numbers for a chip so unpopular that longtime customers were
hanging up on them. The sales force was beaten down and defeated,
and now it stared up at Mount Everest. When I recently asked Bill
Davidow about setting such a steep objective, he replied, “I picked
the two thousand because I thought we needed a rallying point. And
that was a rallying point.”

The company incentivized the reps with a trip for two to Tahiti
for all who reached the mark. Then Jim Lally added an ingenious
stipulation: If a single individual failed to make the quota, the
straggler’s entire district office would lose out on the trip. Early on,
the numbers badly trailed the target, until the task force began to
think about relaxing the design win criterion. But that summer, full-
color Tahiti brochures mysteriously found their way into every
salesperson’s home mailbox. By the third quarter, peer pressure on
the laggards was enormous.

At year’s end, the design win tally exceeded 2,300. The 8086
reigned supreme in the marketplace; Intel’s future was assured.



Virtually the entire sales force went to Tahiti. And a stretch goal had
made all the difference.

The Gospel of 10x

If Andy Grove is the patron saint of aspirational OKRs, Larry Page is
their latter-day high priest. In technology, Google stands for
boundless innovation and relentless growth. In the world of
objectives and key results, the company is synonymous with
exponentially aggressive goals, or what author Steven Levy calls
“the gospel of 10x.”

Consider Gmail. The main problem with earlier web-based email
systems was meager storage, typically 2 to 4 megabytes. Users were
forced to delete old emails to make room for new ones. Archives
were a pipe dream. During Gmail’s development, Google’s leaders
considered offering 100MB of storage—an enormous upgrade. But
by 2004, when the product was released to the public, the 100MB
goal was dead and forgotten. Instead, Gmail provided a full
gigabyte of storage, up to five hundred times more than the
competition. Users could keep emails in perpetuity. Digital
communication changed forever.

That, my friends, is a Big Hairy Audacious Goal. Gmail didn’t
merely improve on existing systems. It reinvented the category and
forced competitors to raise their game by orders of magnitude. Such
10x thinking is rare in any sector, on any stage. Most people, Larry
Page observes, “tend to assume that things are impossible, rather
than starting from real-world physics and figuring out what’s
actually possible.”

In Wired, Steven Levy elaborated:

The way Page sees it, a ten percent improvement means that
you’re doing the same thing as everybody else. You probably
won’t fail spectacularly, but you are guaranteed not to succeed
wildly.

That’s why Page expects Googlers to create products and
services that are ten times better than the competition. That
means he isn’t satisfied with discovering a couple of hidden
efficiencies or tweaking code to achieve modest gains.



Thousand percent improvement requires rethinking
problems, exploring what’s technically possible and having
fun in the process.

At Google, in line with Andy Grove’s old standard, aspirational
OKRs are set at 60 to 70 percent attainment. In other words,
performance is expected to fall short at least 30 percent of the time.
And that’s considered success!

Eric Schmidt, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin with Google’s first self-driving car,
2011—10x thinking in action!

Google has had its share of colossal misfires, from Helpouts to
Google Answers. Living in the 70 percent zone entails a liberal
sprinkling of moonshots and a willingness to court failure. At the
start of the period, not a single goal may look possible. And so the
Googlers are pushed to ask harder questions: What radical, high-
risk action needs to be considered? What do they need to stop
doing? Where can they move resources or find new partners? By
deadline, a healthy fraction of those impossible goals are somehow
attained in full.



Stretch Variables

To succeed, a stretch goal cannot seem like a long march to
nowhere. Nor can it be imposed from on high without regard to
realities on the ground. Stretch your team too fast and too far, and it
may snap. In pursuing high-effort, high-risk goals, employee
commitment is essential. Leaders must convey two things: the
importance of the outcome, and the belief that it’s attainable.

Few entities have Google’s resources to fall back upon when a
moonshot crashes. Organizations have a range of risk tolerance,
which may change over time. The greater the margin for error, the
more a company can extend itself. For example, a 40 percent OKR
failure rate might seem too risky—and too discouraging, no matter
what leadership says. For high achievers, anything shy of perfection
can sap morale. At Risk Management Solutions in California, there
are “more degrees than employees,” says Amelia Merrill, a former
HR leader. “People here are used to getting A’s. They don’t get B’s.
Not getting 100 percent—that’s just really hard, culturally, to make
that transition.”

At MyFitnessPal, Mike Lee considers all OKRs to be committed
goals: difficult and demanding, yes, but attainable in full. “I am
trying to set the bar right at where I think it should be,” he says. “If
we get them all done, I’ll feel good about our progress.” That’s a
reasonable approach, but not without pitfalls. Will Mike’s people
shy away from objectives where they might top out at 90 percent? In
my view, it’s better for leaders to set at least a modest stretch. Over
time, as teams and individuals gain experience with OKRs, their key
results will become more precise and more aggressive.

There is no one magic number for the “right” stretch. But
consider this: How can your team create maximum value? What
would amazing look like? If you seek to achieve greatness,
stretching for amazing is a great place to start. But by no means, as
Andy Grove made clear, is it the place to stop:

You know, in our business we have to set ourselves uncomfortably tough
objectives, and then we have to meet them. And then after ten
milliseconds of celebration we have to set ourselves another [set of]
highly difficult-to-reach objectives and we have to meet them. And the
reward of having met one of these challenging goals is that you get to play
again.

Stretch: The Google Chrome Story

Sundar Pichai
CEO

S tretch goals were beautifully defined by the leader of the
Google X team that developed Project Loon and self-driving
cars. Says Astro Teller: “If you want your car to get fifty miles

per gallon, fine. You can retool your car a little bit. But if I tell you it
has to run on a gallon of gas for five hundred miles, you have to
start over.”

In 2008, Sundar Pichai was Google’s vice president of product
development. When Sundar and his team took their Chrome
browser to market, they were most definitely starting over. Driven
to succeed but unafraid of failure, they used OKRs to catapult their
product—and their company—to amazing. Chrome is now the most
popular web browser by far on both the mobile and desktop
platforms. As you will see, there were bumps in the road. But as
Larry Page says, “If you set a crazy, ambitious goal and miss it,
you’ll still achieve something remarkable.” When you aim for the
stars, you may come up short but still reach the moon.

The career of Sundar Pichai is a stretch goal personified. In
October 2015, at age forty-three, Sundar became Google’s third
CEO. Today he presides over an organization with more than sixty
thousand employees and $80 billion in revenues.

—
Sundar Pichai: Growing up in South India in the 1980s, I had scant exposure
to technology as we see it today. Yet what we had made a profound impact on
my life. My father was an electrical engineer in Chennai, a great metropolis, but
we lived modestly. The waiting list for a telephone—a rotary dial model—was



three to four years. I was twelve years old when my family finally got one. It was
a big event. Neighbors would come and use it.

I remember my life as pre-phone and post-phone; that one device changed
so many things. Pre-phone, my mother would say, “Can you see if the blood
test is ready in the hospital?” I would catch a bus and ride to the hospital, and
wait in line, and often they would tell me, “No, it isn’t ready yet, come tomorrow.”
By the time I rode the bus home, it was a three-hour trip. Post-phone, I could
simply call the hospital and know the results. Now we take technology for
granted, and it gets better every day. But for me there were these discrete
moments, before and after, that I will never forget.

I read every book about computers and semiconductors that I could lay my
hands on. I aspired to somehow make it to Silicon Valley, which meant getting
into Stanford—that was my goal, to be a part of all the change happening there.
In a way, I think I dreamt even more fervently because so little technology was
available to us. I was driven by the power of imagining.

The New Applications Platform
For five years, I worked at Applied Materials in Santa Clara, in process
engineering, R&D. Sometimes I would need to go to Intel, and I could feel the
Andy Grove culture as soon as I stepped inside the door. The company was
very disciplined, down to the smallest thing. (I vaguely remember having paid
for each cup of coffee.) In semiconductor process engineering, you must be
highly methodical in setting your goals and working your way through them. So
my work at Applied Materials helped me think about goals in a more precise
way.

As the internet continued to develop, I could see its tremendous potential. I
read about everything Google was doing—I was passionate on the subject. I
was especially excited when they launched a product called Deskbar, where
you could search the web from Windows without opening the browser—it
launched from a small window in the taskbar. It was there when you needed it,
but only then. Deskbar was an early tool for growth, a way to bring Google to
many more people.

I joined Google as a product manager in 2004, when the company still
revolved around search. But that was also the year of Web 2.0 and the rise of
user-generated content and AJAX.* The early web was a content platform, but it
was fast becoming an applications platform. We were seeing the beginning of a
paradigm shift on the internet, and I sensed that Google would be at the heart of
it.

My first assignment was to expand the use and distribution of Google
Toolbar, which could be added to any browser to get you to Google Search. It
was the right project for the right time. In just a few years, we scaled up Toolbar



users by more than 10x. That was when I first saw the power of an ambitious,
stretch OKR.

Rethinking the Browser
By then we’d set up something new for Google, a team to build client software.
We had people working on Firefox to help improve Mozilla’s browser. By 2006,
we were beginning to rethink the browser as a computing platform, almost like
an operating system, so that people could write applications on the web itself.
That fundamental insight gave birth to Chrome. We knew we needed a
multiprocess architecture to make each tab its own process and protect a user’s
Gmail if another application crashed. And we knew we had to get JavaScript
working a lot faster. But we were up for the task of building the best browser
possible.

Eric Schmidt, our CEO, knew how hard it was to construct a browser from
scratch: “If you’re doing it, you had better be serious about it.” If Chrome wasn’t
going to be dramatically different and better and faster than the traditional
browsers already on the market, there was no point in moving ahead.

In 2008, the year of Chrome’s rollout, our product management team
formulated a top-level annual objective that would have an enduring influence
on Google’s future: to “develop the next-generation client platform for web
applications.” The main key result: “Chrome reaches 20 million seven-day
active users.”

Upping the Goal
In Google’s OKR climate, it was understood that 70 percent achievement (on
average) was considered a success. You weren’t supposed to strive for greens
on every OKR you wrote—that wouldn’t stretch the team. But there was an
intrinsic tension because you didn’t get hired at Google unless you were driven
to succeed. As a leader, you didn’t want to find yourself at the end of the
quarter, standing in front of the company with a big red on the screen, having to
explain why and how you failed. The pressure and discomfort of that experience
made a lot of us do a lot of heroic things to avoid it. But if you set your team’s
objectives correctly, it was sometimes unavoidable.

Larry was always good about upping the goals for the company OKRs. He
used certain phrases that stuck with me. He wanted people at Google to be
“uncomfortably excited.” He wanted us to have “a healthy disregard for the
impossible.” I tried to do the same for the products team. It took courage to write
an OKR that might well fail, but there was no other way if we wanted to be



great. We deliberately set the bar for 20 million weekly active users by year’s
end, knowing it was a formidable stretch—we were starting from zero, after all.

As a leader, you must try to challenge the team without making them feel the
goal is unachievable. I thought it unlikely we would reach our target in time.
(Candidly, I thought there was no way we would get there.) But I also
considered it important to keep pushing to the limit of our ability and beyond. By
putting the 20 million out there, I knew good things would happen. Our stretch
OKR gave the team direction and a barometer to measure our progress. It
made complacency impossible. And it kept us all rethinking, every day, the
framework for what we were doing. All of these things were more important than
reaching a somewhat arbitrary target on a designated day.

Early on, as Chrome struggled to reach 3 percent market share, we received
some unanticipated bad news. The Mac version of Chrome fell way behind
schedule. Only Windows users would count toward the 20 million.

But there was good news, too—people who used Chrome loved it, which
was starting to have a compounding effect on growth. Glitches notwithstanding,
we were driving awareness of a new way to engage the web. We just needed to
find more users, and sooner than later.

Digging Deeper
Google stands for speed. The company has waged a constant battle against
latency, the delay in a data transfer that degrades the user experience. In 2008,
Larry and Sergey wrote a beautiful OKR that truly captured people’s attention:
“We should make the web as fast as flipping through a magazine.” It inspired
the whole company to think harder about how we could make things better and
faster.

For the Chrome project, we created a sub-OKR to turbocharge JavaScript.
The goal was to make applications on the web work as smoothly as downloads
on a desktop. We set a moonshot goal of 10x improvement and named the
project “V8,” after the high-performance car engine. We were fortunate to find a
Danish programmer named Lars Bak, who’d built virtual machines for Sun
Microsystems and held more than a dozen patents. Lars is one of the great
artists in his field. He came to us and said, without an ounce of bravado, “I can
do something that is much, much faster.” Within four months, he had JavaScript
running ten times as fast as it ran on Firefox. Within two years, it was more than
twenty times faster—incredible progress. (Sometimes a stretch goal is not as
wildly aspirational as it may seem. As Lars later told Steven Levy in In the Plex,
“We sort of underestimated what we could do.”)

Stretch OKRs are an intense exercise in problem solving. Having gone
through the Toolbar journey, I had a good sense of how to work my way through
the inevitable troughs. Sure, there were sleepless nights. But no matter how
much stress I was feeling, I stayed cautiously optimistic with my team. If we



were losing users, I would tell them, let’s do an experiment to understand why
and fix it. If compatibility was an issue, I’d assign a group to focus on that. I tried
to be thoughtful and systematic and not too emotional, and I think that helped.

Google is propelled by our moonshot culture. The very ambitious is very
hard to do. In a healthy way, our team realized that the success of Chrome
would ultimately mean hundreds of millions of users. Whenever we invent
something new at Google, we’re always thinking: How can we scale it to a
billion? Early in the process, that number can seem very abstract. But when you
set a measurable objective for the year and chunk the problem, quarter by
quarter, moonshots become more doable. That’s one of the great benefits of
OKRs. They give us clear, quantitative targets on the road to those qualitative
leaps.

After we failed against the 20 million in 2008, it made us dig deeper. We
never gave up on the objective, but we changed the way we framed it. Here’s
what I tried to communicate: “No, we didn’t reach the goal, but we are laying the
foundation to break through this barrier. Now, what are we going to do
differently?” In a culture of smart people, you had better have good answers to
that question; you can’t tap-dance your way through. In this case, we needed a
solution to one very basic problem: Why was it so difficult to get people to try a
new browser?

That’s how we became motivated to find new distribution deals for Chrome.
Down the road, when we found that people were unclear about just what a
browser did for them, we turned to television marketing to explain it. Our
Chrome ads represented the largest offline campaign in the company’s history.
People still remember “Dear Sophie,”* a spot created around a father’s digital
scrapbook of his daughter as she grew. It showed the easy entrée from our
browser to such a rich stock of web-based applications, from Gmail and
YouTube to Google Maps. It led people to the internet as an applications
platform.

Try-Fail, Try-Succeed
Success was not instantaneous. In 2009, we set another stretch OKR for
Chrome—50 million seven-day active users—and failed again, ending the year
at 38 million. For 2010, undeterred, I proposed a target of 100 million users.
Larry believed we should be pushing even harder. My target, he pointed out,
touched only 10 percent of the world’s one billion internet users at the time. I
countered that 100 million was in fact very aggressive.

Larry and I eventually settled on an OKR of 111 million users, a classic
stretch goal. To reach it, we knew we’d need to reinvent the business of
Chrome and think about growth in new ways. Again, what could we do
differently? In February, we broadened our distribution deals with the OEMs
[original equipment manufacturers]. In March, we embarked on a “Chrome Fast”



marketing campaign to heighten product awareness in the United States. In
May, we expanded our demographic by launching Chrome for OS X and Linux.
At last, our browser was no longer a Windows-only product.

Well into the third quarter, the outcome remained in doubt. Then we did a
small thing that became a big thing: a passive alert for former Chrome users
who’d been dormant. Weeks later, at the end of Q3, our user total had surged
from 87 million to 107 million. And shortly after that, we reached 111 million
seven-day actives. We had achieved our goal.

Today, on mobile alone, there are more than a billion active users of
Chrome. We couldn’t have gotten there without objectives and key results.
OKRs are the way we think about everything at Google, the way we’ve always
done it.

Sundar presents his Chrome keynote at Google’s I/O developer conference,
2013.

The Next Frontier
My father came of age in a time when computing meant huge teams and
mainframes and system administrators—when computers were both
inaccessible and very complicated. By the time I was working on Chrome, I



realized that all he wanted was an easy, straightforward way to use the web.
I’ve always been fascinated by simplicity. For all the complex things Google
Search could do, the user experience was phenomenally uncomplicated. I
wanted to emulate that quality in our browser—to the point where you could be
a kid in India or a professor at Stanford, and it wouldn’t matter. If you had
access to a computer and adequate connectivity, your experience with Chrome
would be manifestly simple.*

In 2008, when my father was retired, I gave him a netbook and showed him
how to use Chrome. And then an amazing thing happened for him: The
technology just faded away. He could just do whatever he wanted on the
thriving applications platform on the web. Once he got into our browser, he
never opened another app. He never downloaded another piece of software. He
lived in Chrome. He surrendered into a new and wonderfully simple world.

At Google, from very early on, I internalized the need to constantly imagine
the next frontier—from Toolbar to Chrome, for example. You can never stop
stretching. My father’s experience got us thinking: What if we could design an
operating system with comparable simplicity and security, with the Chrome
browser as its user interface? And what if we could invent a laptop around that
operating system—a Chromebook—to tap directly into all of those applications
living in the cloud?

But those would be stretch goals for another day.

Stretch: The YouTube Story

Susan Wojcicki
CEO

Cristos Goodrow
Vice President of Engineering

G oogle is so teeming with stretch goals that it would feel
incomplete to chronicle only one of them. And so here is a
second, the story of YouTube and how it grew—

exponentially—with the “stretch” OKR superpower.
Susan Wojcicki, according to Time magazine, is “the most

powerful woman on the internet.” She’s played a central role at
Google from the start, even before becoming employee No. 16 and
the company’s first marketing manager. In September 1998, days
after Google was incorporated, Susan rented out her Menlo Park
garage for the company’s first office. Eight years later, as analysts
doubted that YouTube would survive, she was a leading voice in
persuading Google’s board to acquire it. Susan had the vision to see
that online video was about to disrupt network television—forever.



Susan Wojcicki and her Menlo Park garage, where it all began.

By 2012, YouTube had become a market leader and one of the
biggest video platforms in the world. But its furious pace of
innovation had slowed—and once you brake, it’s not easy to
reaccelerate. By that point, Susan had risen to senior vice president
of advertising and commerce, where she reimagined AdWords and
envisioned a new way to monetize the web with AdSense. (Basically,
she drove the success of Google’s two main revenue streams.) In
2014, as the new CEO of YouTube, she inherited one of the most
aggressive goals anytime, anywhere. Over a span of four years, the
mission was to reach a billion hours of people watching YouTube
every day—to grow by a factor of ten. But Susan didn’t want to grow
at any cost—she wanted to do this responsibly. Susan and a veteran
YouTube engineering leader, Cristos Goodrow, had their work cut
out for them. They would rely on OKRs every step of the way.

Stretch goals are invigorating. By committing to radical,
qualitative improvement, an established organization can renew its
sense of urgency and reap tremendous dividends. YouTube’s once
struggling web video business has scaled to more than a billion
users, nearly a third of the total population on the internet. Its site
can be navigated in more than seventy different languages in more



than eighty countries. Its mobile platform alone reaches more
eighteen-to-forty-nine-year-olds than any cable or broadcast
network.

None of this happened by accident, or by the grace of a single
insight. It took years of rigorous execution, meticulous attention to
detail, and the structure and discipline of OKRs. And one more
thing: Before YouTube could begin to chase its monumentally
audacious objective, first it had to figure out how to measure what
mattered.

—
Susan Wojcicki: When I leased my garage to Larry and Sergey, I had no
interest in Google as a company. I just wanted them to pay the rent. But then I
got to know them and how they thought about things. I had ideas for starting my
own company, but it dawned on me that Larry and Sergey were better
positioned to execute them. And then there was the day Google Search went
down and I couldn’t get my work done. Google, I realized, had become an
indispensable tool; I couldn’t live without it. And I thought, This is going to be
important for everyone.

I was there when John Doerr came to talk to us about OKRs in the fall of
1999. By then we’d outgrown my garage and moved to 2400 Bayshore in
Mountain View, an old Sun Microsystems plant. The whole building might have
been 42,000 square feet, and we operated in less than half of it. We had the
OKR meeting in the other half, the part reserved for all-hands. I can remember
John explaining the concept: “This is an objective. This is a key result.” And
using the football analogy to demonstrate how OKRs were implemented. The
other day, sorting through some files, I came across John’s presentation—on
plastic laminate sheets for an overhead projector. That’s how old it was.

Larry and Sergey were good at listening to people who knew what they were
talking about. I’m sure they argued with John, but they listened. They had never
run a company or even worked in a company before. John came in and said,
“This is a way you can run your business, and it’s measurable and trackable.”
Measurables were intuitive to Larry and Sergey, and they had to be impressed
by the fact that Intel used OKRs. Intel was such a great company, and we were
so small by comparison.

Judging from our experience at Google, I’d say that OKRs are especially
useful for young companies just starting to build their culture. When you’re little,
with fewer resources, it’s even more vital to be clear on where you’re going. It’s
like raising kids. If you bring them up with no structure, and then you tell them
as teenagers, “Okay, now here are the rules”—well, that’s going to be hard. If
possible, it’s better to have rules from the start. At the same time, I’ve seen
mature companies do turnarounds and change people and processes. No
company is too young to adopt OKRs, and for no company is it too late.



OKRs require organization. You need a leader to embrace the process and
a lieutenant to ride herd over scoring and reviews. When I ran OKRs for Larry, I
sat in on four-hour meetings with his leadership team, where he’d debate all the
company objectives and people were expected to be able to defend them and
make sure they were clear. The guidance for OKRs at Google was often top-
down, but with lots of discussion with experts on the team and significant give-
and-take on key results: This is the direction we want to go, now tell us how
you’re going to get there. Those long meetings enabled Larry to emphasize
things he cared about, and also to vent frustrations, especially around service
on our product OKRs. He’d say, “Tell me your speed now.” And then: “Why
can’t you cut that in half?”

We still conduct our all-hands, top-level OKR meeting in a special videocast
each quarter, though Google is now so large and multifaceted that it’s hard to
communicate everything we do to everyone. At one memorable all-hands, Salar
Kamangar, my predecessor as YouTube CEO, did an amazing job running
through the company’s entire OKR roster. (Salar can put anything into context.)
But in general, the more detailed discussions take place within our teams. And
you’ll still find OKRs posted on the company and team pages on Google’s
intranet, updated in real time, where any contributor can access and review
them.

If You Can’t Beat ’Em . . .
Google Videos, our free video-sharing website, launched in 2005, one month
before YouTube. When I ran it, the first clip we uploaded for users was a purple
Muppet singing a nonsense song from an Italian movie about sex in Sweden.
Sergey and I weren’t sure what to make of it. But then my kids shouted, “Play it
again!” The light bulb went on. We saw a next-generation opportunity, a new
way for people to create video for global distribution. We went about building an
interface, and had our surprising first hit: two kids singing Backstreet Boys in
their dorm room, with a roommate studying in the background. We carried some
professional videos, too, but the user-generated content did better.

The main flaw in Google Videos was a delay in our upload process. It broke
a company rule for product development: Make it fast. User-uploaded videos
weren’t immediately available to watch, whereas on YouTube they were—a big
problem. By the time we fixed it, we’d lost significant market share. YouTube
was out-streaming us three to one, but financially they were struggling.
Swamped by demand, they urgently needed capital to build infrastructure. It
was clear they would have to sell.

I saw an opportunity to combine the two services. I worked up some
spreadsheets to justify the $1.65 billion purchase price, to show that Google
could make its money back, and convinced Larry and Sergey. At the last
minute, the founders asked me to bring my spreadsheets to the board meeting.



There were lots of questions. The board gave us the green light, though they
weren’t totally sold on my assumption for year-on-year user growth. And it’s
funny, because rapid growth is the one thing that YouTube has consistently
delivered to this day.

Big Rocks
Cristos Goodrow: In February 2011, when I came over from Google Product
Search, three years before Susan joined the team, YouTube’s OKRs needed
work. The company—around eight hundred people at the time—was producing
hundreds of them each quarter. A team would open a Google doc and start
typing in objectives, and they’d wind up with thirty or forty for ten people, and
less than half would actually get done.

Engineers struggle with goal setting in two big ways. They hate crossing off
anything they think is a good idea, and they habitually underestimate how long it
takes to get things done. I’d lived through this at Product Search, where they’d
insist: “Come on, I’m a smart person. I can surely get more done than that.” It
took discipline for people to narrow their lists to three or four objectives for their
team, but it made a huge difference. Our OKRs became more rigorous.
Everybody knew what counted most. After I took responsibility for search and
discovery at YouTube, it only made sense to do the same thing there.

Then Salar Kamangar turned over day-to-day leadership for the tech side of
YouTube to Shishir Mehrotra, and Shishir helped bring focus to the whole
company. He used a metaphor called the Big Rocks Theory, which was
popularized by Stephen Covey. Say you have some rocks, and a bunch of
pebbles, and some sand, and your goal is to fit as much of everything as you
can into a wide-mouth, one-gallon jar. If you start with the sand, and then the
pebbles, the jar will run out of room for all the rocks. But when you start with the
rocks, add the pebbles, and save the sand for last, the sand fills the spaces
between the rocks—everything fits. In other words, the most important things
need to get done first or they won’t get done at all.

But what were YouTube’s big rocks? People did their own things and let a
thousand flowers bloom, but no one could identify the top-level OKRs. Now
leadership was saying, “All of your ideas are wonderful. But could we please
identify a few of them as our big rocks for this quarter, and for the year?” After
that, everyone at YouTube knew our top priorities. All of our big rocks would
make it into the jar.

That was a giant step toward the goal that swallowed the next four years of
my life.

A Better Metric



YouTube had figured out how to make money, but they still weren’t sure how to
grow viewership. Fortunately for the company and me, an engineer in Google
Research Group was out in front of us. On a dedicated team named Sibyl, Jim
McFadden was building a system for selecting “watch next” recommendations,
aka related videos or “suggestions.” It had tremendous potential to boost our
overall views. But were views what we really wanted to boost?

As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has pointed out: In a world where
computing power is nearly limitless, “the true scarce commodity is increasingly
human attention.” When users spend more of their valuable time watching
YouTube videos, they must perforce be happier with those videos. It’s a
virtuous circle: More satisfied viewership (watch time) begets more advertising,
which incentivizes more content creators, which draws more viewership.

Our true currency wasn’t views or clicks—it was watch time. The logic was
undeniable. YouTube needed a new core metric.

Watch Time, and Only Watch Time
In September 2011, I sent a provocative email to my boss and the YouTube
leadership team. Subject line: “Watch time, and only watch time.” It was a call to
rethink how we measured success: “All other things being equal, our goal is to
increase [video] watch time.” For many folks at Google, it smacked of heresy.
Google Search was designed as a switchboard to route you off the site and out
to your best destination as quickly as possible. Maximizing watch time was
antithetical to its purpose in life. Moreover, watch time would be negative for
views, the critical metric for both users and creators. Last (but not least), to
optimize for watch time would incur a significant money hit, at least at the start.
Since YouTube ads were shown exclusively before videos started, fewer starts
meant fewer ads. Fewer ads meant less revenue.*

My argument was that Google and YouTube were different animals. To
make the dichotomy as stark as possible, I made up a scenario: A user goes to
YouTube and types the query “How do I tie a bow tie?” And we have two videos
on the topic. The first is one minute long and teaches you very quickly and
precisely how to tie a bow tie. The second is ten minutes long and is full of jokes
and really entertaining, and at the end of it you may or may not know how to tie
a bow tie. I’d ask my colleagues: Which video should be ranked as our first
search result?

For those at Google Search, the answer was easy: “The first one, of course.
If people come to YouTube to tie a bow tie, we surely want to help them tie a
bow tie.”

And I’d say, “I want to show them the second video.”
And the Search cohort would protest, “Why would you do that? These poor

people just want to tie their bow ties and get to their event!” (They were
probably thinking: This guy’s insane.) But my point was that YouTube’s mission



was fundamentally divergent. It’s fine for viewers to learn to tie bow ties, and if
that’s all they want, they’ll choose the one-minute manual. But that’s not what
YouTube was about, not really. Our job was to keep people engaged and
hanging out with us. By definition, viewers are happier watching seven minutes
of a ten-minute video (or even two minutes of a ten-minute video) than all of a
one-minute video. And when they’re happier, we are, too.

It took six months, but I won the argument. On the Ides of March, 2012, we
launched a watch-time-optimized version of our recommendation algorithm
aimed at improving user engagement and satisfaction. Our new focus would
make YouTube a more user-friendly platform, particularly for music, how-to
videos, and entertainment and late-night comedy clips.

A Big Round Number
In November 2012, at our annual YouTube Leadership Summit in Los Angeles,
Shishir gathered a few of us together. He said he was about to announce a big
stretch goal to kick off the coming year: one billion hours in daily user watch
time. (There is power in simplicity, and round numbers are simple.) He asked
us, “When can we get this done? What’s the time frame?” A billion hours
represented a 10x increase, and we knew it would take years, not months. We
thought 2015 was too soon, and 2017 sounded weird. (Prime numbers, in
general, sound weird.) Just before Shishir took the stage, we settled on the end
of 2016, a four-year OKR with a set of rolling, annual objectives and quarterly,
incremental key results.

OBJECTIVE
Reach 1 billion hours of watch time per day [by 2016],

with growth driven by:

KEY RESULTS
1. Search team + Main App (+XX%), Living Room (+XX%).
2. Grow kids’ engagement and gaming watch time (X

watch hours per day).
3. Launch YouTube VR experience and grow VR catalog

from X to Y videos.

Principled Stretching



Stretch goals can be crushing if people don’t believe they’re achievable. That’s
where the art of framing comes in. Clever manager that he is, Shishir cut our
BHAG down to size. While one billion daily hours sounded like an awful lot, it
represented less than 20 percent of the world’s total television watch time.
Introducing that context was helpful and clarifying, at least for me. We weren’t
gunning to be arbitrarily big. Rather: There was another thing out there way
bigger than us, and we were trying to scale up to it.

In pursuing our mission over the next four years, we weren’t 10x absolutists.
In fact, we’d commit to some watch-time-negative decisions for the benefit of
our users. For example, we made it a policy to stop recommending trashy,
tabloid-style videos—like “World’s Worst Parents,” where the thumbnail showed
a baby in a pot on the stove. Three weeks in, the move proved negative for
watch time by half a percent. We stood by our decision because it was better for
the viewer experience, cut down on click bait, and reflected our principle of
growing responsibly. Three months in, watch time in this group had bounced
back and actually increased. Once the gruesome stuff became less accessible,
people sought out more satisfying content.

Once the billion-hour BHAG was set, however, we never did anything
without measuring impact on watch time. If a change might slow our progress,
we’d be scrupulous about estimating just how much. Then we’d build internal
consensus before going through with it.

Getting Up to Speed
Susan: Salar Kamangar most enjoys the earlier stages of companies. He likes
taking them to the next level; he’s really good at that. By 2012, YouTube had
grown into a big organization, and Salar decided to move on. The company had
split into two factions, business and technology, and needed someone to bring
them together. After leading AdWords for a decade, I was used to complex
ecosystems. I was eager to take on the challenge of unifying YouTube.

When YouTube leadership set the one-billion-hour daily watch time goal,
most of our people judged it impossible. They thought it would break the
internet! But it seemed to me that such a clear and measurable objective would
energize people, and I cheered them on.

By February 2014, when I came over, YouTube was nearly a third of the way
through the four-year, mega-stretch OKR. But while the objective was well
planted, it wasn’t quite on pace. Watch-time growth had dropped significantly
below what we needed to make our deadline, a source of stress for all involved.
While Google aims for a grade of 0.7 (or 70 percent attainment) on stretch goals
in aggregate, and there are times people totally fail, no team goes into an OKR
saying, “Let’s settle for 70 percent and call it a success.” Everyone tries to get to
100 percent, especially once an objective seems within reach. It’s safe to say



that no one at YouTube would have been satisfied to reach 700 million daily
watch-time hours.

In all honesty, though, I wasn’t certain we’d reach the billion hours on time. I
thought it would be okay if we missed by a little bit, as long as everyone stayed
united and aligned. I’d seen us miss objectives at Google, and we’d renew our
focus and roll them forward. In 2007, when we introduced AdSense to monetize
the whole web, the launch was a quarterly OKR. We worked really hard to
release it to the actual day but wound up two days late. No harm was done.

Maybe the best thing about OKRs is how they track your progress to a
target, especially when you’re behind schedule. When I ran Google’s mid-
quarter OKR updates, the point was to figure out how to fix things and get back
on track. The updates were opportunities to gather the leadership team and
say, “Okay, I want each of you to name five projects you can implement to bring
us closer to our goal.” We’d extend the OKR and promote positive behavior. So
I wasn’t super-worried about hitting the billion hours before the clock struck
twelve.

Cristos Goodrow, the OKR’s guardian, had another perspective. The billion
daily hours had become his white whale. Not long after I joined the company, at
our “up-to-speed” meeting, Cristos presented me with a deck of forty-six slides.
By number five, he’d made his point loud and clear: We needed to catch up.

Cristos: I was very concerned. Each year we announced our annual
objectives and areas of focus. From 2013 through 2016, the billion-hour OKR
headlined the presentation. We also had clear interim milestones to stay on
track. When I first met with Susan, I thanked her for keeping our 10x goal. Then
I said, “By the way, we’re way behind. I’m freaked out and I hope that you’re at
least a little freaked out. And when you’re making decisions about what to
prioritize and where to lean, please keep in mind that we are not going to meet
this watch-time OKR if we don’t do something about it.”

Susan: I had some pressing concerns. One was a rearguard action with
Google’s machine people, to make sure we had the infrastructure to support our
goal. It takes a flood of bytes to get YouTube videos from our data centers to
the user, way more than what’s required for email or social media. (The
technical term is “egress bandwidth.”) We do everything we can to guarantee in
advance that Google will have enough servers to route all those bytes to deliver
your cat video to your phone or laptop.

After announcing the billion-hour OKR, YouTube’s leadership team went on
a charm offensive to reserve the bandwidth we’d need through 2016. When I
took the reins, Google’s server group asked to renegotiate what must have
seemed like an exorbitant spend. I was in a tough spot: I was new, and we were
lagging our projected usage. But if we cut back on our machines, I knew it
wouldn’t be easy to recover. So I kicked the can down the road. I said to those
high-powered technical people, “Let’s just stay with the plan for now and meet
again in three months.” I wanted to hang on to our reservations until we knew
where things stood. Three months later, we had more data and more growth
and an easier case to make.



The billion-hour OKR was a religion at YouTube, to the exclusion of nearly
all else. It’s important to respect people’s religion, and I wanted to support that
big stretch goal. But it was so black-and-white that I feared it could be
detrimental if not properly managed. My job was to keep an eye on the gray, the
nuances that might get overlooked. Daily watch time is driven by two factors:
the average number of daily active viewers (or DAVs) and the average amount
of time those viewers spend watching. YouTube was doing a good job on the
second variable—but that was lower-hanging fruit. It’s easier to expand a
relationship than to get a new one started. Our research showed a lot more
growth potential in enlarging our user base than in getting teenage boys to
watch twice as much YouTube. We wanted new users—and so did our
advertisers.

Mutual Support
Cristos: Whenever you get new leadership, everything’s up for review. When
Susan took over YouTube, she wasn’t obligated to get behind the billion-hour
OKR. That was the previous administration’s goal. She could have reverted to a
views goal, or one more oriented toward revenue. Or she could have kept the
watch-time OKR but added three others of equal or greater priority. Had she
done any of those things, we would never have reached the billion hours on
time. We’d have gotten distracted and never caught up.

After Susan arrived, we began putting people’s names next to our YouTube
company goals, with colored bars denoting progress: green, yellow, or red.
“Cristos” was listed cheek by jowl with “one billion hours” at every weekly staff
meeting—quarter after quarter, year after year. I felt personally responsible for
that OKR.

I appreciated the Google creed of setting risky, aggressive goals, and
making it okay to fail against them. And I knew some good things had already
happened. Since declaring the BHAG, my team had significantly improved
video search and recommendations. We were the tip of an OKR spear that had
raised YouTube’s profile and stature throughout Google. The company’s morale
had never been higher. I’d hear marketing people discussing watch time with
real fervor, something I never would have expected.

Even so, this OKR was different, for the company and for me. Early on I told
Shishir that if we failed to make our four-year deadline, I’d resign from Google—
and I meant it. I know that sounds melodramatic, but it’s how I felt. And maybe
that intensity of commitment helped me stick with it.

—
By New Year’s 2016, the beginning of our gun lap, we were on schedule, but
just barely. Then the warm-weather doldrums kicked in, with people spending
more time outside and watching fewer videos. Would they ever come back? As



late as July, our growth rate was lagging our year’s-end goal. I was nervous
enough to ask my team to think about reordering their projects to reaccelerate
watch time.

In September, folks returned from their summer travels. As old viewers
resumed their habits and new ones tuned in, all of our search and
recommendations improvements were amplified. Reaching one billion hours
was a game of inches; our engineers were hunting for changes that might yield
as little as 0.2 percent more watch time. In 2016 alone, they would find around
150 of those tiny advances. We’d need nearly all of them to reach our objective.

By early October, daily watch time was growing well beyond our target rate.
That’s when I knew we were going to make it. Still, I kept checking our watch
time graph every day, seven days a week. When I was on vacation. When I was
sick. And then, one glorious Monday that fall, I checked again—and saw that
we’d hit a billion hours over the weekend. We’d achieved the stretch OKR many
thought was impossible, ahead of schedule.

The next day, for the first time in more than three years, I did not check the
graph.

—
Our landmark OKR had some unanticipated consequences. Through the four-
year push to reach the billion hours of daily watch time, our daily views soared
in parallel. Stretch OKRs tend to set powerful forces into motion, and you can
never be sure where they’ll lead. Another big lesson, for me, was the
importance of support from the top—from Susan, of course, but also from Larry
and Sergey.

The founders weren’t personally enmeshed in YouTube’s business. They
had no way to be certain we had chosen the best possible course, though I
think they were happy it was ambitious and clear. But when lots of people in
Google Search were openly skeptical about our OKR, both Larry and Sergey
were willing to say onstage, “YouTube has this billion-hour goal, and they’re still
working toward it, and I support that.” They gave us the autonomy we needed to
meet the objective we’d set.

Thinking Bigger
Susan: Aspirational goals can prompt a reset for the entire organization. In our
case, it inspired infrastructure initiatives throughout YouTube. People started
saying, “If we’re going to be that big, maybe we need to redesign our
architecture. Maybe we need to redesign our storage.” It became a prod for the
whole company to better prepare for the future. Everybody started thinking
bigger.

Looking back, I doubt we could have reached the goal in four years without
the process, structure, and clarity of that stretch OKR. In a fast-growing
company, it’s a challenge to get everybody to align and focus around the same
objective. People need a benchmark to know how they’re performing against it.
The catch is to find the right one. The billion hours of daily watch time gave our
tech people a North Star.

But nothing stays the same. In 2013, the watch-time metric was the best way
to gauge the quality of the YouTube experience. Now we’re looking at other
variables, from web-added videos and photos to viewer satisfaction and a focus
on social responsibility. If you watch two videos for ten minutes apiece, the
watch time is the same—but which one makes you happier?

So by the time this book is published, we may have found a whole new
metric to grow by. As early as 2015, we began to advance beyond watch time



by factoring user satisfaction into our recommended videos. By asking users
about the content they found most satisfying, and measuring “likes” and
“dislikes,” we could better ensure that they’d feel their time on YouTube was
well spent. In 2017, we introduced a breaking news shelf on the homepage,
which focused on surfacing the most prominent and relevant content from
authoritative news sources. To this day, we are working to incorporate a
broader array of new and meaningful signals into our recommendations. As our
business grows, and YouTube’s role in society evolves, we will continue to hunt
for the right metrics for our services—and with them, the right OKRs.



PART TWO

The New World of Work



15

Continuous Performance
Management: OKRs and CFRs

Talking can transform minds, which can transform
behaviors, which can transform institutions.

—Sheryl Sandberg

A nnual performance reviews are costly, exhausting, and
mostly futile. On average, they swallow 7.5 hours of manager
time for each direct report. Yet only 12 percent of HR leaders

deem the process “highly effective” in driving business value. Only 6
percent think it’s worth the time it takes. Distorted recency bias,
burdened by stack rankings and bell curves, these end-of-year
evaluations can’t possibly be fair or well measured.

What business leaders have learned, very painfully, is that
individuals cannot be reduced to numbers. Even Peter Drucker, the
champion of well-measured goals, understood the limits of
calibration. A manager’s “first role,” Drucker said, “is the personal
one. It’s the relationship with people, the development of mutual
confidence . . . the creation of a community.” Or as Albert Einstein
observed, “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not
everything that counts can be counted.”

To reach goals almost beyond imagining, people must be
managed at a higher level. Our systems for workplace
communication cry out for an upgrade. Just as quarterly OKRs have
rendered pro forma annual goals obsolete, we need an equivalent
tool to revolutionize outdated performance management systems.
In short, we need a new HR model for the new world of work. That
transformational system, the contemporary alternative to annual



reviews, is continuous performance management. It is
implemented with an instrument called CFRs, for:

Conversations: an authentic, richly textured exchange
between manager and contributor, aimed at driving
performance
Feedback: bidirectional or networked communication
among peers to evaluate progress and guide future
improvement

Recognition: expressions of appreciation to deserving
individuals for contributions of all sizes

Like OKRs, CFRs champion transparency, accountability,
empowerment, and teamwork, at all levels of the organization. As
communication stimuli, CFRs ignite OKRs and then boost them into
orbit; they’re a complete delivery system for measuring what
matters. They capture the full richness and power of Andy Grove’s
innovative method. They give OKRs their human voice.

Best of all, OKRs and CFRs are mutually reinforcing. Doug
Dennerline is CEO of BetterWorks, the pioneer in bringing both of
these tools to the cloud and smartphones and in helping hundreds
of organizations make the processes their own. “It’s the marriage
between the two—that’s the real home run,” Doug says. “If a
conversation is limited to whether you achieved the goal or not, you
lose context. You need continuous performance management to
surface the critical questions: Was the goal harder to achieve than
you’d thought when you set it? Was it the right goal in the first
place? Is it motivating? Should we double down on the two or three
things that really worked for us last quarter, or is it time to consider
a pivot? You need to elicit those insights from all over the
organization.

“On the other hand, if you don’t have goals, what the heck are
you talking about? What did you achieve, and how? In my
experience, people are more likely to feel fulfilled when they have
clear and aligned targets. They’re not wandering and wondering
about their work; they can see how it connects and helps the
organization.”

To hazard another football analogy: Let’s say objectives are the
goalposts, the targets you’re aiming for, and key results the



incremental yard markers for getting there. To flourish as a group,
players and coaches need something more, something vital to any
collective endeavor. CFRs embody all the interactions that tie the
team together from one game to the next. They’re the Monday
videotape postmortems, the midweek intrasquad meetings, the
preplay huddles—and the end-zone celebrations for jobs well done.

Reinventing HR

The good news: A change is in the breeze. Ten percent of Fortune
500 companies have already ditched the old once-a-year
performance review system, and their numbers are growing.
Countless smaller start-ups, less tied to tradition, are doing the
same. We’re at the point where nearly every HR custom needs to be
reimagined. A mobile, agile workforce—and a nonhierarchical
workplace—demands no less.

When companies replace—or at least augment—the annual
review with ongoing conversations and real-time feedback, they’re
better able to make improvements throughout the year. Alignment
and transparency become everyday imperatives. When employees
are struggling, their managers don’t sit and wait for some scheduled
day of reckoning. They jump into tough discussions like firefighters,
without hesitation.

It might sound almost too easy, but continuous performance
management will lift every individual’s achievement. It elevates
performance, bottom to top. It works wonders for morale and
personal development, for leaders and contributors alike. And when
leveraged with the quarterly goals and built-in tracking of OKRs, it
can be even more powerful.

In this transitional moment, more organizations are broadening
their evaluations with alternative criteria, like competencies and
team play. Many are now riding parallel tracks, with annual reviews
set alongside continuous performance management and ongoing
conversations. This balance of old and new thinking can work well
for larger companies in particular, some of whom may be happy to
live there forever. Others will cut the cord and drop ratings and
rankings for more transparent, collaboratively developed,
multidimensional review criteria.

Performance Management

Prone to bias Fact driven

Continuous Performance Management at Pact
Pact, the Washington, D.C.–based international trade and development
nonprofit, has seen firsthand the synergy between OKRs and continuous
performance management. Tim Staffa, a Pact director, says:

“We embraced OKRs because our performance management process was
moving to a more frequent cadence. When Pact adopted OKRs, we officially
killed our annual performance review. We replaced it with a set of more
frequent touch points between managers and employees. Internally, we’ve
dubbed this ‘Propel.’ It consists of four elements:

“The first is a set of monthly one-on-one conversations between
employees and their managers about how things are going.

“The second is a quarterly review of progress against our OKRs. We sit
down and say, ‘What did you set out to accomplish this quarter? What were
you able to do—and what weren’t you able to do? Why or why not? What can
we change?’

“Third, we have a semiannual professional development conversation.
Employees talk about their career trajectory—where they’ve been, where they
are, where they want to go. And how their managers and the organization can
support their new direction.

“The fourth bit is ongoing, self-driven insight. We’re constantly surrounded
by positive reinforcement and feedback, but many of us haven’t been trained
to seek it out. Say you give a presentation to your team. After the fact,
somebody comes up to you and says, ‘Hey, nice job.’ Most of us would say,
‘Oh great, thanks,’ and move on. But we want to probe a little deeper: ‘Thank
you. What one thing did you like about it?’ The idea is to capture more specific
feedback in real time.”

An Amicable Divorce



For companies moving to continuous performance management,
the first step is blunt and straightforward: Divorce compensation
(both raises and bonuses) from OKRs. These should be two distinct
conversations, with their own cadences and calendars. The first is a
backward-looking assessment, typically held at year’s end. The
second is an ongoing, forward-looking dialogue between leaders
and contributors. It centers on five questions:

What are you working on?
How are you doing; how are your OKRs coming along?

Is there anything impeding your work?
What do you need from me to be (more) successful?

How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals?

Now, I’m not proposing that performance reviews and goals can
or should be completely severed. A data-driven summary of what
someone has achieved can be a welcome antidote to ratings biases.
And since OKRs reflect a person’s most meaningful work, they’re a
source of reliable feedback for the cycle to come. But when goals are
used and abused to set compensation, employees can be counted on
to sandbag. They start playing defense; they stop stretching for
amazing. They get bored for lack of challenge. And the organization
suffers most of all.

Let’s say Contributor A set extreme stretch goals and somehow
attained 75 percent of them. Does her outperformance merit 100
percent of her bonus—or even 120 percent? Contributor B, by
contrast, reaches 90 percent of his key results, but his manager
knows he didn’t push himself—and, what’s more, that he blew off
several important team meetings. Should he get a larger bonus than
Contributor A?

The short answer is no, not if you want to preserve initiative and
morale.

At Google, according to Laszlo Bock, OKRs amount to a third or
less of performance ratings. They take a backseat to feedback from
cross-functional teams, and most of all to context. “It’s always
possible—even with a goal-setting system—to get the goals wrong,”
Laszlo says. “Maybe the market does something crazy, or a client
leaves their job and suddenly you have to rebuild from scratch. You



try to keep all of that in consideration.” Google is careful to
segregate raw goal scores from compensation decisions. Their OKR
numbers are actually wiped from the system after each cycle!

The formula has yet to be invented for complex human behavior,
because that’s where human judgment comes in. In today’s
workplace, OKRs and compensation can still be friends. They’ll
never totally lose touch. But they no longer live together, and it’s
healthier that way.

As companies transition to continuous performance management, OKRs and
CFRs become mostly independent from compensation and formal evaluations.

Conversations

Peter Drucker was one of the first to stress the value of regular one-
on-one meetings between managers and their direct reports. Andy
Grove estimated that ninety minutes of a manager’s time “can
enhance the quality of your subordinate’s work for two weeks.”
Ahead of the curve, as usual, Andy made one-on-ones mandatory at
Intel. The point of the meeting, he wrote,

is mutual teaching and exchange of information. By talking
about specific problems and situations, the supervisor teaches
the subordinate his skills and know-how, and suggests ways
to approach things. At the same time, the subordinate
provides the supervisor with detailed information about what
he is doing and what he is concerned about. . . . A key point
about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the



subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by
him. . . . The supervisor is there to learn and coach.*

The supervisor should also encourage the discussion of
heart-to-heart issues during one-on-ones, because this is the
perfect forum for getting at subtle and deep work-related
problems affecting his subordinate. Is he satisfied with his
own performance? Does some frustration or obstacle gnaw at
him? Does he have doubts about where he is going?

With contemporary tools to track and coordinate frequent
conversations, Grove’s tenets are more timely than ever.* Effective
one-on-ones dig beneath the surface of day-to-day work. They have
a set cadence, from weekly to quarterly, depending on need. Based
on BetterWorks’ experience with hundreds of enterprises, five
critical areas have emerged of conversation between manager and
contributor:

Goal setting and reflection, where the employee’s OKR plan is
set for the coming cycle. The discussion focuses on how best to
align individual objectives and key results with organizational
priorities.
Ongoing progress updates, the brief and data-driven check-
ins on the employee’s real-time progress, with problem
solving as needed.*
Two-way coaching, to help contributors reach their potential
and managers do a better job.
Career growth, to develop skills, identify growth
opportunities, and expand employees’ vision of their future at
the company.

Lightweight performance reviews, a feedback mechanism to
gather inputs and summarize what the employee has
accomplished since the last meeting, in the context of the
organization’s needs. (As noted earlier, this conversation is
held apart from an employee’s annual compensation/bonus
review.)

As workplace conversations become integral, managers are
evolving from taskmasters to teachers, coaches, and mentors. Say



the head of product has waffled over a design decision, putting a
product release date in jeopardy. Before the next executive team
meeting, an effective CEO/coach might say, “Can you think about
how to be more decisive in this setting? What if you laid out the two
best options but made your own preference clear? Do you think you
could do that?” If the product head agrees, there is a plan. Unlike
negative criticism, coaching trains its sights on future improvement.

Feedback

In her instant classic, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,
Sheryl Sandberg notes: “Feedback is an opinion, grounded in
observations and experiences, which allows us to know what
impression we make on others.” To reap the full benefits of OKRs,
feedback must be integral to the process. If you don’t know how well
you’re performing, how can you possibly get better?

Today’s workers “want to be ‘empowered’ and ‘inspired,’ not told
what to do. They want to provide feedback to their managers, not
wait for a year to receive feedback from their managers. They want
to discuss their goals on a regular basis, share them with others, and
track progress from peers.” Public, transparent OKRs will trigger
good questions from all directions: Are these the right things for
me/you/us to be focused on? If I/you/we complete them, will it be
seen as a huge success? Do you have any feedback on how I/we
could stretch even more?

Feedback can be highly constructive—but only if it is specific.
Negative feedback: “You started the meeting late last week, and

it came off as disorganized.”
Positive feedback: “You did a great job with the presentation.

You really grabbed their attention with your opening anecdote, and
I loved how you closed with next action steps.”

In developing organizations, feedback is generally led by HR and
often scheduled. In more mature organizations, feedback is ad hoc,
real-time, and multidirectional, an open dialogue between people
anywhere in the organization. If we can rate our Uber drivers (and
vice versa), and even rate the raters on Yelp, why can’t a workplace
support two-way feedback between managers and employees?
Here’s the precious opportunity for people to say to their leaders,



What do you need from me to be successful? And now let me tell
you what I need from you.

Not so many years ago, employees made their voices heard by
slipping unsigned notes into the office suggestion box. Today,
progressive companies have replaced the box with always-on,
anonymous feedback tools, from quick-hitting employee surveys to
anonymous social networks and even rating apps for meetings and
meeting organizers.

Peer-to-peer (or 360-degree) feedback is an added lens for
continuous performance management. It can be anonymous or
public or somewhere in between. Is the feedback designed to help
employees move forward in their careers? (If so, it’s channeled
privately to the individuals.) Is it meant to reveal an organization’s
problem areas? (Here it goes straight to HR.) It’s all a matter of
context and purpose.

By fostering connections among teams, peer feedback is
especially valuable in cross-functional initiatives. When horizontal
communication blows open, interdepartmental teamwork becomes
the new normal. As OKRs are combined with 360-degree feedback,
the silo will soon be a relic of the past.

Recognition

Here is the most underestimated component of CFRs, and the least
well understood. Gone are the days when gold watches were coveted
awards for simple longevity. Modern recognition is performance-
based and horizontal. It crowdsources meritocracy. When JetBlue
installed a value-driven, peer-to-peer recognition system, and
leaders began noticing people who’d flown under their radar,
metrics for employee satisfaction nearly doubled.

Continuous recognition is a powerful driver of engagement: “As
soft as it seems, saying ‘thank you’ is an extraordinary tool to
building an engaged team. . . . ‘[H]igh-recognition’ companies have
31 percent lower voluntary turnover than companies with poor
recognition cultures.” Here are some ways to implement it:

Institute peer-to-peer recognition. When employee
achievements are consistently recognized by peers, a



culture of gratitude is born. At Zume Pizza, the Friday all-
hands “roundup” meeting concludes with a series of
unsolicited, unedited shout-outs from anyone in the
organization to anyone else who’s done something
remarkable.

Establish clear criteria. Recognize people for actions and
results: completion of special projects, achievement of
company goals, demonstrations of company values.
Replace “Employee of the Month” with “Achievement of the
Month.”
Share recognition stories. Newsletters or company blogs
can supply the narrative behind the accomplishment, giving
recognition more meaning.

Make recognition frequent and attainable. Hail smaller
accomplishments, too: that extra effort to meet a deadline,
that special polish on a proposal, the little things a manager
might take for granted.
Tie recognition to company goals and strategies.
Customer service, innovation, teamwork, cost cutting—any
organizational priority can be supported by a timely shout-
out.

OKR platforms are custom-built for peer-to-peer recognition.
Quarterly goals establish and reestablish the areas where feedback
and recognition are most valued. Transparent OKRs make it natural
for coworkers to celebrate big wins and smaller triumphs alike. All
deserve their share of the limelight.

Once teams and departments start connecting in this fashion,
more and more people get on board, and a recognition engine revs
up an entire company. Anyone can cheer anyone else’s goal,
irrespective of title or department. And mark this: Every cheer is a
step toward operating excellence, the crowning purpose of OKRs
and CFRs.

Ditching Annual Performance
Reviews: The Adobe Story

Donna Morris
Executive Vice President

Customer and Employee Experience

S ix years ago, like most businesses, the software company
Adobe was saddled with antiquated annual performance
reviews. Managers invested eight hours per employee and

demoralized everyone involved. Voluntary attrition spiked every
February, as waves of contributors reacted to disappointing reviews
by taking their talent elsewhere. In all, the company devoted a total
of eighty thousand manager hours—the equivalent of nearly forty
full-time hires—to a mechanical process that created no discernible
value. Adobe was transitioning full speed ahead to a cloud-based
subscription business model, which it needed to keep winning. But
even as the company moved its products and customer relations
into a contemporary, real-time operation, its approach to HR
remained shackled to the past.



Adobe’s leap into the future, as reported in the India Times in 2012.

In 2012, during a business trip to India, an Adobe executive
named Donna Morris vented her frustrations over traditional
performance management. Her guard lowered by jet lag, she told a
reporter that the company planned to abolish annual reviews and
stack rankings in favor of more frequent, forward-facing feedback.
It was a great idea. The catch was that she hadn’t yet discussed it
with her HR staff or with Adobe’s CEO.

With characteristic energy and persuasiveness, Donna hustled to
bring the company around. As she wrote on Adobe’s intranet, the
challenge at hand was to “review contributions, reward
accomplishments, and give and receive feedback. Do they need to be
conflated into a cumbersome process? I don’t think so. It’s time to
think radically differently. If we did away with our ‘annual review,’
what would you like to see in its place? What would it look like to
inspire, motivate, and value contributions more effectively?” Her



post sparked one of the most widely engaged discussions in
company history.

Donna’s candor became the catalyst for “Check-in,” Adobe’s new
mode of continuous performance management. In a collective effort
to move the company forward, managers, employees, and peers join
in multiple Check-in conversations each year. Instead of falling back
on the HR team, leaders throughout the organization take proactive
ownership of the process.

Lightweight, flexible, and transparent, with minimal structure
and no tracking or paperwork, Check-in features three focus areas:
quarterly “goals and expectations” (Adobe’s term for OKRs), regular
feedback, and career development and growth. Sessions are called
by contributors and decoupled from compensation. Forced-
distribution stack rankings have been replaced by an annual
Rewards Check-in. Managers are trained to scale compensation
based on employees’ performance, their impact on the business, the
relative scarcity of their skills, and market conditions. There are no
fixed guidelines.

Since the fall of 2012, when Check-in was installed, Adobe’s
voluntary attrition has dropped sharply. By implementing
continuous performance management with CFRs, Adobe has
invigorated its entire business operation.*

—
Donna Morris: Adobe was founded on four core values: genuine, exceptional,
innovative, and involved. Our old annual review process contradicted every one
of them. So I said to our people: What if there were no ratings and no rankings
and no forms? Instead, what if you all knew what was expected of you and had
the opportunity to grow your career at Adobe, where each of you is so valued?

Check-in has helped us to live Adobe’s values every day. To explain how the
new process worked, we kicked it off with the first of a series of thirty-to-sixty-
minute web training conferences. We rolled them out to senior leaders, then
managers, then employees. (We had a 90 percent employee participation rate.)
Each quarter we’ve addressed a different phase of Check-in, from setting
expectations to giving and receiving feedback.

We’ve also invested in an employee resource center, which offers templates
and videos to help our people build their constructive feedback skill set. Adobe
has a lot of engineers who weren’t necessarily experienced with open dialogue.
The center has helped them ease into the process.

Our leaders role-modeled Check-in. They needed to show they were open to
feedback themselves, and comfortable being questioned on their vision.

Now we treat every manager as a business leader. They are allocated
budgets for base incentives and equity, a pool of money to be distributed as



they see fit. It’s super-empowering for them to know they are truly responsible
for their reports. It’s equally empowering for employees to know they have input
into the process. By scheduling regular Check-ins through the year, they keep
their manager apprised of their progress against action items and goals from
prior conversations, along with development needs and ideas for how they
might grow. And now that we’ve done away with fixed pots of compensation,
teammates are no longer competitors.

Donna Morris speaking at Goal Summit, 2017.

Individuals want to drive their own success. They don’t want to wait till the
end of the year to be graded. They want to know how they’re doing while they’re
doing it, and also what they need to do differently. Under our new system, our
contributors get highly specific performance feedback at least once every six
weeks. But in practice it happens every week. Everybody knows where they
stand and how they’re contributing value to the company. Instead of lagging, the
performance management process is leading.

Our feedback under Check-in is often manager-to-employee, but it can be
flipped to employee-to-manager: “I felt like I was out on a limb with project X
and needed more support.” And because Adobe is heavily matrixed, feedback
can also be peer-to-peer. In my department, for example, I have a



communication partner, a finance partner, and a legal partner. While they report
to other people, there are strong dotted lines between us. We review our
expectations and give one another feedback on our performance.

From Adobe’s experience, I’d say that a continuous performance
management system has three requirements. The first is executive support. The
second is clarity on company objectives and how they align with individual
priorities—as set out in our “goals and expectations,” which equate to OKRs.
The third is an investment in training to equip managers and leaders to be more
effective. We’re not shipping people out to courses. We’re steering them to one-
hour sessions online, with role-played vignettes: “Do you need to give difficult
feedback? Here are the steps.”

Corrective feedback is naturally difficult for people. But when done well, it’s
also the greatest gift you can give to someone—because it can change people’s
mindset and modify their behavior in the most positive, valuable way. We’re
creating an environment where people say, “You know what? It’s okay to make
a mistake, because that’s how I’m going to grow the most.” That’s a big part of
our culture change.

As Check-in makes clear, HR leaders exist for the success of the business.
Our role is to consult with other leaders on how to make all of our constituents
successful in fulfilling the company’s mission. Success isn’t built by forms and
rankings and ratings. It’s not driven by policies and programs that bog people
down and get in their way. The true mechanisms for success are the ones that
build capabilities and enable people to deliver for the company.

Baking Better Every Day: The
Zume Pizza Story

Julia Collins and Alex Garden
Cofounders and Co-CEOs

A s we’ve seen, OKRs and CFRs are proven vehicles for high
performance and exponential growth. They also have more
subtle, internal, quotidian effects—like grooming better

executives, or giving less vocal contributors an opportunity to shine.
On the long and demanding road to operating excellence, they help
organizations improve each and every day. Leaders become better
communicators and motivators. Contributors grow into more
disciplined, rigorous thinkers. When imbued with meaningful
conversations and feedback, structured goal setting teaches people
how to work within constraints even as they push against them—an
especially critical lesson for smaller, scaling operations.

The Zume Pizza story vividly illustrates these internal dynamics.
It’s about a start-up using OKRs and CFRs—plus a few robots—to
take on the giants of its industry.

For some time now, the $10 billion U.S. pizza delivery market
has been controlled by three national chains: Domino’s, Pizza Hut,
and Papa John’s. They aren’t life-altering pizzas, but their brands
are well established and own the great advantage of economy of
scale. In the spring of 2016, when Zume Pizza opened for business
in an out-of-the-way concrete bunker in Silicon Valley, the skeptics
came out in droves. “Roboticized, artisanal pizza” was derided as a
Left Coast gimmick. The odds for success seemed long.

Going on two years later, Zume is beating those odds by making
world-class pizza at a competitive price. The company assigns rote



tasks to machines, freeing its people for creative jobs that add more
value. Dollars saved on manual labor get plowed into higher-quality
ingredients: dough from non-GMO flours, organically grown
tomatoes, locally sourced vegetables, and healthfully cured meats.
The result is a tastier pie that’s actually good for you—and that
arrives, still hot, as little as five minutes after you input your order.

As online or mobile app orders link into Zume’s conveyor belt,
robots stretch and shape the dough, apply the sauce, and safely slide
the pizzas into an 800-degree oven. With robotics technology
continuing to mature, the company plans to automate the entire
process, from adding cheese and custom toppings to loading the
partly baked pies into Zume’s fleet of algorithmically operated,
baking-on-the-way trucks. (In the future, there’s a fair chance those
trucks will be driverless.)

Within three months of launch, Zume had achieved 10 percent
market share in its local trade area. In 2018, it began disrupting the
pizza oligopoly across the Bay Area. Soon it will roll out across the
West Coast, and then nationally; by 2019, the founders hope to be
overseas. “We’re going to be the Amazon of food,” says cofounder
Alex Garden, who first met OKRs as president of Zynga Studios.

Zume cofounders Julia Collins and Alex Garden with their baking-on-the-way
pizza truck.



When you’re David taking on Goliath, time and opportunity are
of the essence. There’s no margin for unfocused operations or
misaligned staff. As Zume’s leaders will tell you, OKRs have helped
their young company to thrive in ways they could not have foreseen.

—
Julia Collins: In the beginning, Zume lived in our two heads. If you asked Alex
and me any question, we would give you the same answer; we spent so much
time together that everything was understood. That works fine with two people.
After our CTO came on board and we became “the three cheeses,” it still
worked really well. But once we added Parmigiano-Reggiano to the mozzarella,
Romano, and provolone, something changed. By the time we had seven
people, if you asked us, “What’s the main thing we need to accomplish
today?”—well, you’d get eight different answers.

A Zume Pizza robot in action.

We started with the project management software called LiquidPlanner, a
“waterfall” methodology. It really helped build out our kitchen. First you pour the
concrete and let it dry; then you put on the epoxy and let that dry; then you
cover it and install the walk-in refrigerator box, right? For a linear process, it’s
fantastic.

But by June 2016, as we prepared to launch, Zume was a more complex
operation. We were up to sixteen salaried employees, plus another three dozen
hourly kitchen workers and “pilots,” the indispensable people who deliver our



pizza. We’d ventured into large-scale manufacturing, plus integrating robots,
plus developing software, plus creating a menu . . . and the waterfall stopped
flowing so smoothly. Too many things were happening at once, with lots of
layers of interdependencies. We knew we had to stay agile, and our engineers
checked in on JIRA’s project management software each morning for their two-
week sprints. But neither JIRA nor LiquidPlanner could answer one big
question: What’s the most important thing to do?

Zume’s biggest asset is our talented and creative team. Left to their own
devices, our folks would jump into what they thought was most important. Their
ideas were often good but not always in sync. We implemented OKRs early in
our life cycle, three weeks after the first pizza went out the door, because we
wanted to be sure that everyone knew our top priorities. In the beginning, to
make sure that mission-critical things got done, Alex and I set a standard of 100
percent top-down alignment. The two of us created Zume’s objectives for our
first two OKR cycles. Going forward, as survival becomes less of an issue, we’ll
loosen up a little bit.

Achieving What’s Real
Alex Garden: It’s hard to deny the explicit value of OKRs, like how they help tie
an organization to the leadership’s true ambitions. But for young companies like
Zume, especially, there’s an equally important implicit value that gets
overlooked. OKRs are a superb training tool for executives and managers. They
teach you how to manage your business within existing limits. It’s important to
push the envelope, but the envelope is real. Everybody faces resource
constraints: time, money, people. And the bigger an organization, the more
entropy—it’s like thermodynamics. During my stint as a general manager at
Microsoft’s Xbox Live, I worked with some visionary executives. But we
struggled from a misalignment between the leaders’ desires and the capabilities
of the organization. The “hows”—and most of the “whats,” as well—were left to
me and some other divisional foot soldiers. It was our job to execute an
impractically framed mandate for an overscoped mission. If we’d had a well-
constructed goal-setting process from the start, it might have saved everyone a
lot of grief.

Old-school business models suggest that your role as an executive gets
more abstract as you rise in the ranks. Your middle managers buffer you from
the operational day-to-day, freeing you to focus on the big picture. Maybe that
worked in a slower-paced era. But in my experience, OKRs can’t be effective
unless the people at the top are unconditionally committed—like a religious
calling. And proselytizing is hard and thankless work. Your people may not like
you very much through the adoption curve, which can take up to a year. But it’s
worth it.



Better Discipline
Julia: If we’re talking about the intrinsic value of OKRs, what comes before
anything is the discipline that they instill in us as co-CEOs.

Alex: They train us to be thoughtful about what we can actually achieve, and
to instill the same outlook in our executive team and their teams. Early on in
your career, when you’re an individual contributor, you’re graded on the volume
and quality of your work. Then one day, all of a sudden, you’re a manager. Let’s
assume you do well and move up to manage more and more people. Now
you’re no longer paid for the amount of work you do; you’re paid for the quality
of decisions you make. But no one tells you the rules have changed. When you
hit a wall, you think, I’ll just work harder—that’s what got me here.

What you should do is more counterintuitive: Stop for a moment and shut out
the noise. Close your eyes to really see what’s in front of you, and then pick the
best way forward for you and your team, relative to the organization’s needs.
What’s neat about OKRs is that they formalize reflection. At least once each
quarter, they make contributors step back into a quiet place and consider how
their decisions align with the company. People start thinking in the macro. They
become more pointed and precise, because you can’t write a ninety-page OKR
dissertation. You have to choose three to five things and exactly how they
should be measured. Then when the day comes and someone says, “Okay,
you’re a manager,” you’ve already learned how to think like one. And that’s
huge.

Most start-ups aren’t too eager to plunge into structured goal setting: We
don’t need that. We go super-fast. We just figure stuff out. And often they do
figure it out. But I think they’re missing an opportunity to teach people how to be
executives before the company scales. If those habits aren’t ingrained early on,
one of two things happens: Unsuccessful companies scale beyond the
leadership team’s capacity, and they die. Successful companies scale beyond
the team’s abilities and the team gets replaced. Those are both sad outcomes.
The better way is to train people to think like leaders from the start, when their
departments have a staff of one.

So OKRs forge your people. They mint stronger executives and help them
avoid rookie mistakes. They implant the rigor and rhythm of a very large
company into the framework of a very small company. When we implemented
OKRs at Zume, the immediate benefit was the process itself. The simple act of
forcing people to think about the business—thoughtfully, transparently,
interdependently—was a huge accelerant to their performance.

Better Engagement
Alex: OKRs take out the ambiguity. And when you do that, some people will
say, “This isn’t what I thought I signed up for, and I’m leaving.” But others will



say, “I’m inspired because I finally know what we’re trying to do.” Either way,
there’s clarity. For those who stay, you’ve laid the foundation for engagement.
Everybody’s bought in to the mission. Team sports don’t work unless the whole
team plays together.

Julia: As people get more familiar with the OKR process, it naturally gets
more collaborative. In Q3 of 2016, Alex and I wrote the top company OKRs, and
the department heads converted some of our key results into their own
objectives. We just cascaded them down. In Q4, the two of us still wrote the
company objectives, but our team jumped in and KRed them from the top,
which was great. They took on a more creative role, and the OKRs got better.
Our goals were still stretched, but people felt they were more realistic.

Zume calls its key technology “baking on the way.” That’s where we disrupt
the industry and create the most delight for our customers. In Q4, a top
company objective was to deploy our big guys, the twenty-six-foot trucks with
fifty-six ovens linked to a sophisticated logistics and order prediction system.
They enable us to finish your pizza algorithmically, in as little as five minutes
after your online order, and have it ready—and still steaming—as we pull up to
your door. Vaibhav Goel, our product manager, owned an OKR to order,
coordinate, and fulfill the first flotilla of our baking-on-the-way fleet. It was
airtight. If Vaibhav attained his three KRs, we knew we’d reach our objective.

OBJECTIVE
Complete the Truck Delivery Fleet for 250 Polaris

(Mountain View HQ).

KEY RESULTS
1. Deliver 126 fully certified ovens by 11/30.
2. Deliver 11 fully certified racks by 11/30.
3. Deliver 2 fully certified full-format delivery vehicles by

11/30.

Every organization has people who are more vocal in asserting themselves.
If they don’t win their point the first time, they’re comfortable saying it again. But
quieter folks may not be heard so well, and their needs can get neglected. The
OKR framework gives equal voice and weight to each department. No one
needs to suffer in silence—truthfully, no one has that option. Your objectives will
get their turn up on the screen, like everyone else’s, for comment and support.

I’d add that a really good company values different opinions. It mines for
dissent, and it finds a way to bring it up to the surface and mine it out. That’s
how we foster a meritocracy.

Alex: Before rolling OKRs out to our individual contributors, we put in two full
quarters at the exec level. We had to establish the culture first. What we’ve
found, oddly enough, is that our most active participants are the ones who were
initially most skeptical.



Joseph Suzuki (director of marketing): I thought it another diet program—
Just follow this process and you’ll be thin and beautiful. It felt like bookkeeping,
one more administrative exercise. But OKRs had an effect on me I didn’t
expect. When I did my biweekly check-ins, it gave me a couple minutes to think
about what I was doing, and how my goals rolled up to what the company
needed for the quarter.

At a start-up, you can get lost in tactical minutiae—especially in my
department, where we wear so many hats. That’s dangerous, because you’re
swimming in tumultuous seas and it’s easy to lose sight of land. But those OKR
meditations helped me reset my compass: How do I contribute to the scheme of
things? Then it’s not just another report or campaign or field event. It connects
to something bigger and more meaningful.

Better Transparency
Julia: From the beginning, the process forced us to clarify who’s in charge of
what. When a fly ball is hit between two outfielders, somebody’s got to call for it
—or else the ball drops in, or both people dive for it and crash into each other.
Early on, our fielders were marketing and product—but who was responsible for
Zume’s revenue targets? The two leads had been with us one month apiece.
Not only were they new to OKRs, but they were also new to Zume, and Zume
was new to itself. When Alex and I saw their confusion, we broke the objective
out into new revenue (marketing) and repeat revenue (product), and the
department heads drilled down from there. That was an important conversation.
It wasn’t linked to an objective, per se, but it was absolutely a by-product of an
early-stage OKR process. When something isn’t clearly delineated, it shows up
right away. You can’t miss it.

Better Teamwork
Alex: In eight months we launched a food company, a logistics company, a
robotics company, and a manufacturing company—from a standing start. We
used OKRs as a teaching tool to impart a culture of consideration. They make
you start thinking reflexively about how the work you’re doing affects those
around you, and how you’re dependent on them, too.

Julia: Our team is very eclectic. Our executive chef, Aaron Butkus, came up
through mom-and-pop restaurants around New York City. Our fleet manager,
Mike Bessoni, worked in movie production. We’ve got a product wonk and a
software engineer, and everyone came in speaking different languages. OKRs
were our Esperanto, our shared vocabulary. The seven-member leadership
team meets over lunch every Monday, and about every other week we discuss



our OKRs. You hear people saying things like “Who owns the customer?” or
“How would you key-result that goal?” And everyone knows just what they
mean.

The most delicious pie in the world won’t make people happy if it gets to
them cold. Mike and Aaron own a shared objective for customer satisfaction.
Mike might say, “I’ve got a key result for expanding our delivery radius, and now
it’s at risk.” Maybe the manufacturing team was delayed in getting a vehicle
online. So now we’ll have a collective conversation on how the late deployment
is affecting our service area and revenue stream. Which also ties in to Joe
Suzuki, our marketing lead, and his OKR to increase top-line revenue.

In another life, Mike might have called out the manufacturing lead: “What the
hell, can you hurry up and get this done? I’ve been waiting forever!” When you
say instead, “My KR is at risk,” it’s less charged and more constructive. Since
our company has total alignment, the entire team has already agreed to the key
result and the dependency it entails. There’s no judgment, just a problem to be
solved. And guess what else happens? The two leads will advocate for each
other to get more resources from Alex and me.

Aaron Butkus (executive chef): If I’m creating a new seasonal pie, I can’t
do it on the spur. Marketing needs to know at least a week ahead of time, and
then photo and design have to take pictures. It affects every department—the
product manager’s website, the tech team and their mobile app. The OKRs
keep me centered and on track. They guarantee that I get the recipe done in
time for everyone who’s waiting on it. My deadline’s built into a key result. I can
see the bigger picture more clearly.

It’s definitely a team-building process. It reminds you that you’re a part of this
little, weird community. It’s easy to get caught up in your own issues, especially
when you’re working in the kitchen. But OKRs get people to think, Oh yeah,
we’re working together on this, we’re working together on everything.

Better Conversations
Alex: Every two weeks, each person at Zume has a one-hour, one-on-one
conversation with whomever they report to. (Julia and I converse with each
other.) It’s a sacred time. You cannot be late; you cannot cancel. There’s only
one other rule: You don’t talk about work. The agenda is you, the individual, and
what you are trying to accomplish personally over the next two to three years,
and how you’re breaking that into a two-week plan. I like to start with three
questions: What makes you very happy? What saps your energy? How would
you describe your dream job?

Then I say, “Look, I want to tell you what my expectations are. Number one,
always tell the truth. Number two, always do the right thing. If you meet those
expectations, we’ll unconditionally back you, one hundred percent of the time.
And I will personally guarantee you that you’re going to achieve your next set of



personal and professional goals over the next three years.” And we go from
there.

People might see this as altruism, but it’s actually a powerful way to get
people connected to the business—and to keep them from churning out. It gives
them insights around obstacles. A leader might say, “This goal seems very
important to you, but you didn’t make a lot of progress on it the last two weeks.
Why is that?” It may seem paradoxical, but these nonwork, touchpoint one-on-
ones are a forum for ongoing performance feedback. In talking about people’s
pursuit of personal goals, you end up learning a lot about what moves them
forward—or holds them back—in their careers.

When you’re having regular, deeper conversations, you get a sense of when
you need to turn the dial and give people a chance to charge their batteries.
After the organization has completed an all-out sprint, you might dial up
contributors’ time for personal development goals—say, from 5 percent to 15 or
20 percent—the next quarter. It might sound like a huge tax, but it will set up the
company’s two or three quarters of execution.

Better Culture
Julia: Culture is the common language that allows for individuals in an
organization to be sure they’re all talking about the same thing—and that what
they’re talking about has meaning. Beyond that, culture establishes a common
framework for decision making. In its absence, people are at a loss for how to
make key functions replicable and scalable.

Then there’s the more aspirational layer of culture: the values conversation.
Who do we want to be as an organization? How do we want people to feel
about their work, and about our product? What’s the impact we want to make on
the world?

Alex: Zume’s founding principles—our mission—are two things Julia said to
me on the phone when we were first introduced. They made such an
impression on me that we put them up on a giant poster on our kitchen wall.
The first was: Serving food to people is a sacred trust. And the second: Every
American has a right to delicious, affordable, healthy food.

Here’s an OKR that flowed directly from our mission:

OBJECTIVE
Delight customers.

DETAIL
Feeding people is a sacred trust. To maintain that trust,

we have to deliver the very best customer service and the
very best food quality. To succeed as a business, we

must ensure that our customers are so happy with our



service and product that they have no choice but to order
more pizza and to rave about the experience with their

friends.

KEY RESULTS
1. Net Promoter Score of 42 or better.
2. Order Rating of 4.6/5.0 or better.
3. 75% of customers prefer Zume to competitor in blind

taste test.

Julia: There are so many daily decisions that are governed by our mission. It
would be easy to use a tiny bit more salt in our pizzas. Or add a little bit of sugar
to the sauce rather than going the extra mile to find the freshest tomatoes.
Those are the small, insidious compromises that can creep into an organization
and undermine who you are.

Every new employee goes through mission and values training as part of
their onboarding. Alex and I are very clear about what we expect from people.
And our clarity forces us to be highly accountable, as an organization and as
individuals. We have a best-idea-wins culture, and people are free to call out
anybody, including the CEO.

Alex: Especially the CEO, that’s the best call-out there is. When people
challenge us in an open forum, we always stop and make a huge big deal about
how impressive it is that the person spoke up. We try to overdo it, to create
permission for people to lean in.

Better Leaders
Julia: I’ve worked for some great leaders in my day. They were all very
different, but one thing they had in common was this cold, sober focus. If you
sat down with them for twenty minutes, they were completely uncluttered in their
thinking. They could drill down very clearly on what needed to be done. When
you’re fund-raising and making pizza with robots and building out kitchens,
there’s a lot of rapid context switching. It can feel a little frenetic at times. But
when you know your company objectives like you know your last name, it’s very
calming. OKRs help me to be that focused, clear-headed leader. No matter how
crazy things get, I can always default back to what matters.

Culture

You need a culture that high-fives small and
innovative ideas.

—Jeff Bezos

C ulture, as the saying goes, eats strategy for breakfast. It’s our
stake in the ground; it’s what makes meaning of work.
Leaders are rightly obsessed with culture. Founders ask how

they can protect their companies’ cultural values as they grow.
Chiefs of large companies are turning to OKRs and CFRs as tools for
culture change. And growing numbers of job seekers and career
builders are making the right cultural fit their top criterion.

As you have seen throughout this book, OKRs are clear vessels
for leaders’ priorities and insights. CFRs help ensure that those
priorities and insights get transmitted. But goals cannot be attained
in a vacuum. Like sound waves, they require a medium. For OKRs
and CFRs, the medium is an organization’s culture, the living
expression of its most cherished values and beliefs.

And so the question becomes: How do companies define and
build a positive culture? While I have no simple answer, OKRs and
CFRs provide a blueprint. By aligning teams to work toward a
handful of common objectives, then uniting them through
lightweight, goal-oriented communications, OKRs and CFRs create
transparency and accountability, the tent poles for sustained high
performance. Healthy culture and structured goal setting are
interdependent. They’re natural partners in the quest for operating
excellence.

Andy Grove understood the paramount importance of this
interplay. “Put simply,” he wrote in High Output Management,



culture is “a set of values and beliefs, as well as familiarity with the
way things are done and should be done in a company. The point is
that a strong and positive corporate culture is absolutely essential.”
As an engineer, Grove equated culture with efficiency, a manual for
quicker, more reliable decisions. When a company is culturally
coherent, the way forward is understood:

Someone adhering to the values of a corporate culture—an intelligent
corporate citizen—will behave in consistent fashion under similar
conditions, which means that managers don’t have to suffer the
inefficiencies engendered by formal rules, procedures, and
regulations. . . . [M]anagement has to develop and nurture the common
set of values, objectives, and methods essential to the existence of trust.
How do we do that? One way is by articulation, by spelling [them] out. . . .
The other even more important way is by example.

As an executive, Grove role-modeled Intel’s highest cultural
standards. In his iOPEC seminars, he endeavored to instill them in
the company’s new employees. On the following page you’ll find two
original slides from 1985, an outline of Andy’s teachings on Intel’s
seven core cultural values:






Intel Slide—Operating Style

The qualities prized by Andy Grove—collective accountability,
fearless risk taking, measurable achievement—are also highly
esteemed at Google. In Project Aristotle, an internal Google study of
180 teams, standout performance correlated to affirmative
responses to these five questions:

1. Structure and clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our
team clear?

2. Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling
insecure or embarrassed?

3. Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally
important for each of us?

4. Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high-quality work
on time?

5. Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re
doing matters?



The first item on this list—structure and clarity—is the raison
d’être for objectives and key results. The others are all key facets of a
healthy workplace culture, and tie directly to OKR superpowers and
CFR communication tools. Consider peer-to-peer “dependability.”
In a high-functioning OKR environment, transparency and
alignment make people more diligent in meeting their obligations.
At Google, teams assume collective responsibility for goal
achievement—or for failures. At the same time, individuals are held
responsible for specific key results. Peak performance is the product
of collaboration and accountability.

An OKR culture is an accountable culture. You don’t push toward
a goal just because the boss gave you an order. You do it because
every OKR is transparently important to the company, and to the
colleagues who count on you. Nobody wants to be seen as the one
holding back the team. Everybody takes pride in moving progress
forward. It’s a social contract, but a self-governed one.

In The Progress Principle, Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer
analyzed 26 project teams, 238 individuals, and 12,000 employee
diary entries. High-motivation cultures, they concluded, rely on a
mix of two elements. Catalysts, defined as “actions that support
work,” sound much like OKRs: “They include setting clear goals,
allowing autonomy, providing sufficient resources and time, helping
with the work, openly learning from problems and successes, and
allowing a free exchange of ideas.” Nourishers—“acts of
interpersonal support”—bear a striking resemblance to CFRs:
“respect and recognition, encouragement, emotional comfort, and
opportunities for affiliation.”

In the high-stakes arena of culture change, OKRs lend us purpose
and clarity as we plunge into the new. CFRs supply the energy we
need for the journey. Where people have authentic conversations
and get constructive feedback and recognition for superior
accomplishment, enthusiasm becomes infectious. The same goes for
stretch thinking and a commitment to daily improvement. The
companies that treat their people as valued partners are the ones
with the best customer service. They have the best products and
strongest sales growth. They’re the ones who are going to win.

As continuous performance management rises to the fore, once-
a-year employee surveys are giving way to real-time feedback. One



frontier is pulsing, an online snapshot of your workplace culture.
These signal-capturing questionnaires may be scheduled weekly or
monthly by HR or made part of an ongoing “drip” campaign. Either
way, pulses are simple, quick, and wide-ranging. For example: Are
you getting enough sleep? Have you met recently with your
manager to discuss goals and expectations? Do you have a clear
sense of your career path? Are you getting enough challenge and
motivation and energy—are you feeling “in the zone”?

Feedback is a listening system. In the new world of work, leaders
cannot wait for negative critiques on Glassdoor, or for valued
contributors to exit for another job. They need to listen and capture
signals as they are emitted. What if a goal-setting platform could
pulse two or three questions to employees whenever they log in?
What if it merged quantitative data on goal progress with qualitative
input from frequent conversations and pulsing feedback? We’re not
far away from software that will prompt a manager: “Talk to Bob,
something’s going on with his team.”

As OKRs build goal muscle, CFRs make those sinews more
flexible and responsive. Pulsing gauges the organization’s real-time
health—body and soul, work and culture.

Leading the world in online higher education, Coursera jumped into
OKRs in 2013, just one year after its founding. With timely input
from then-president Lila Ibrahim, an Intel alumna who revered
Andy Grove, the organization tried something rare and exemplary.
They connected OKRs explicitly to the company’s values and lofty
mission statement, a clear expression of its culture: “We envision a
world where anyone, anywhere, can transform their lives by
accessing the world’s best learning experience.” Coursera rolled up
its team-level objectives to top-line strategic objectives, which in
turn rolled up to five core values:

Students first. Engage and increase value to students;
extend reach to new students.
Great partners. Be a great partner to universities.

Think big and advance pedagogy. Develop an innovative,
world-class education platform.



Care for teammates and be human, be humble. Build a
strong, healthy organization.

Do good, do well. Experiment and develop a sustainable
business model.

Each core value was mapped to a corresponding set of OKRs. As
an example, here is an OKR for “students first”:

OBJECTIVE
Extend Coursera’s reach to new students.

KEY RESULTS
1. Perform A/B tests, learn, and iterate on ways to acquire

new students and engage existing students.
2. Increase mobile monthly active users (MAU) to 150k.
3. Create internal tools to track key growth metrics.
4. Launch features to enable instructors to create more

engaging videos.

OKRs furnished the pathway for Coursera’s mission. They
enabled teams to articulate their goals and to align with the
company’s objectives—and with its broader values, as well. Years
later, the company’s friendly, inclusive culture remains a welcome
contrast to the blustery, combative personality of many Silicon
Valley start-ups.

Daphne Kohler (to the left of John Doerr), and cofounder Andrew Ng (far

As Rick Levin, Coursera’s former CEO, said, “I can’t imagine
where we would be without OKRs. The discipline forces us to look
back every quarter and hold ourselves accountable, and to look
ahead every quarter to imagine how we can better live our values.”

In 2007, the preeminent business philosopher Dov Seidman
published a groundbreaking book on culture, HOW: Why HOW We
Do Anything Means Everything . . . in Business (and in Life). Dov
started from the premise that culture guides people’s behaviors, or
how things really happen in an organization. In our open-sourced,
hyperconnected world, behavior defines a company more
meaningfully than product lines or market share. As Dov said to me
recently, “It’s the one thing that can’t be copied or commoditized.”

Dov’s big idea is that companies that “out-behave” their
competition will also outperform them. He identified a value-driven
model, the “self-governing organization,” a place where long-term
legacy trumps the next quarter’s ROI. These organizations don’t
merely engage their workers. They inspire them. They replace rules
with shared principles; carrots and sticks are supplanted by a



common sense of purpose. They are built around trust, which
enables risk taking, which spurs innovation, which drives
performance and productivity.

“In the past,” Dov told me, “when employees just needed to do
the next thing right—to follow orders to the letter—culture didn’t
matter so much. But now we’re living in a world where we’re asking
people to do the next right thing. A rulebook can tell me what I can
or can’t do. I need culture to tell me what I should do.”

That was a majestic, potentially transformative idea. But as Dov
has acknowledged, it’s one thing to proclaim values like courage or
compassion or creativity. It’s another to scale them. Scaling requires
a system, with metrics. “What we choose to measure is a window
into our values, and into what we value,” Dov says. “Because if you
measure something, you’re telling people that it matters.”

To validate his argument and test his observations, Dov needed
data—lots of it. His team at LRN embarked upon a rigorous
empirical analysis that has been refined over the years and
published in a series of annual HOW reports.

Where Andy Grove added qualitative goals to balance
quantitative ones, Dov has found a way to quantify seemingly
abstract values like trust. His “trust index” measures specific
behaviors—the direct “hows” of transparency, for example. “I avoid
asking people about their perceptions,” Dov told me. “I don’t ask,
‘Do you feel your company is honest with you?’ I look at information
flows. Does the company hoard information, does it mete it out on a
need-to-know basis, or is it flowing freely? If you go around your
boss and talk to somebody more senior, are you punished or
celebrated?”

As of 2016, the HOW report covered seventeen countries and
more than sixteen thousand employees. It found that self-governing
organizations had grown to 8 percent of the pie, up from 3 percent
in 2012. Of those value-driven companies, 96 percent scored high in
systematic innovation. Ninety-five percent had superior employee
engagement and loyalty. “Out-behavior” did indeed equate to
outperformance; 94 percent reported increased market share.

When Dov told me there was no more powerful cultural force
than “active transparency,” where “human beings are opening up,
sharing the truth, bringing others in, being vulnerable,” I could see
Andy Grove smiling. An OKR/CFR culture is above all a transparent
culture. It goes back to the lessons I first learned at Intel, and have



seen affirmed countless times at Google and dozens of other
forward-looking companies. Vision-based leadership beats
command-and-control. The flatter the org chart, the more agile the
organization. When performance management is a networked, two-
way street, individuals grow into greatness.

At the end, it’s all about knitting ourselves to one another. As
Dov observes, “Collaboration itself—our ability to connect—is an
engine of growth and innovation.”

Given the chance, OKRs and CFRs will build top-down
alignment, team-first networking, and bottom-up autonomy and
engagement—the pillars of any vibrant, value-driven culture. But in
some scenarios, as you’re about to see in the following tale about
Lumeris, culture change may need to be initiated before OKRs are
deployed. In others, as Bono and his ONE Campaign will show, a
charismatic CEO/founder (in this case, a literal rock star) can call
on OKRs to transform culture from the top. And so our final two
stories explore this rich interrelationship between culture change
and structured goal setting.

Culture Change: The Lumeris Story

Andrew Cole
Chief HR/Organizational Development Officer

W hen an organization isn’t yet ready for total openness and
accountability, culture work may be needed before OKRs
are implemented. As Jim Collins observes in Good to

Great, first you need to get “the right people on the bus, the wrong
people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats.” Only then
do you turn the wheel and step on the gas.

Not too long ago, a leader in value-based health care stood at a
crossroads. Lumeris is a St. Louis–based technology and solutions
firm that provides software, services, and know-how to health care
providers and payers. Its clientele ranges from university hospital
networks to traditional insurers. The company had started in 2006
by partnering with a group of 200 St. Louis–area physicians
through a federally regulated insurance company, Essence
Healthcare, to serve 65,000 Missouri seniors with a Medicare
Advantage plan.

Tapping into a vast trove of patient data, Lumeris helps partner
organizations convert traditional, fee-for-service, volume-based
“sick care” into something else entirely: a health care delivery
system that incentivizes prevention and discourages needless tests
or detrimental hospital stays. Under this value-based model,
primary-care doctors take responsibility for their patients, cradle to
grave. The goal is to improve quality of life while conserving
precious resources and dollars. At Lumeris they’ve shown how those
objectives can work hand in hand.

According to CEO Mike Long, the moonshot goal is to rationalize
the nation’s health care supply chain: “In every other industry,



success is based on transparent cost, quality, service, and the
availability of choices. None of those principles work in health care,
because the system is completely opaque. Doctors have difficulty
knowing what services are requisitioned on your behalf, much less
what they cost. So how then can you hold them accountable for
financial outcomes?” It’s a transformational challenge, and Lumeris
—aided by OKRs—is leading the charge.

Given its reliance on transparent data, Lumeris seemed a natural
fit for Andy Grove’s goal-setting system. But as Andrew Cole, the
former head of HR, will tell you, adaptation was anything but
simple. If cultural barriers go unaddressed, as Andrew says, “The
antibodies will be set loose and the body will reject the donor organ
of OKRs.” As an experienced architect of sweeping organizational
change, Andrew was the right person in the right seat to make sure
the OKR transplant took.

—
Andrew Cole: When I came to Lumeris, they had been working with OKRs for
three quarterly cycles—on paper. They had an outstanding employee
participation rate, or so I was told. But after a deep-dive analysis, I realized the
process was superficial. At the end of the quarter, a lone HR person ran around
like a Jack Russell, nipping at managers’ heels to get updated numbers before
the board meeting. People dropped into the software platform, conveniently
adjusted an objective’s metrics, and said, “Oh yeah, I got that done.” They’d
slap on a date and check off a box. It looked great on PowerPoint, but it wasn’t
real.

Few of our people understood the business rationale behind OKRs. We
were missing explicit buy-in from executive leadership. Most of all, nobody held
anybody accountable for getting the system right. When I examined people’s
objectives, they weren’t connected to the actual work. I’d go to managers and
ask, “Why does this show up in your OKRs?” In many cases, they had no idea
how their objectives linked up to what we were working to achieve. It was so
much window dressing.

I try to understand an organization before I charge in, breaking things. But
two quarters later, I still wasn’t sure the OKR process could be saved. In a
closed board session, I asked John Doerr, “If I don’t think this tool is right for us,
then we won’t do it, right?” And he said, “Absolutely.” By then I’d diagnosed our
root problem, a passive-aggressive approach. No one had addressed a basic
question everyone at Lumeris was asking: “What’s in this for me?” Though the
OKR program was sincerely intended to improve goal setting and collaborative
communication, people didn’t trust it. Unless we changed the environment, it
couldn’t possibly succeed.

Transformation doesn’t happen overnight. The executive team had brought
in OKRs to help integrate two clashing internal cultures. Essence, the health



insurance company formed by the St. Louis doctors’ group, was risk averse, per
Hippocrates; Lumeris pushed to the edge to find the next big tech and data
insights. Essence nurtured a proprietary model within a hypercompetitive
industry; Lumeris took those learnings and shared them with the world.

As demand for our services began surging, this culture gap was slowing us
down. In May 2015, eleven weeks after I arrived, we announced a total
reorganization under the Lumeris umbrella. (One company, our reasoning went,
should have one name.) I knew that OKRs could eventually be our lingua
franca, a way to connect everyone’s goals, but that would need to wait. Without
cultural alignment, the world’s best operational strategy will fail.

HR Transformation
People watch what you do more than what you say. Lumeris had some senior
leaders with an old-school, autocratic approach. They weren’t living our core
values: ownership, accountability, passion for the job, loyalty to the team.
Nothing else would matter until those leaders exited the organization. We made
sure they left us with their dignity and respect intact, a telling moment in any
transformation project.

At each and every culture meeting, we told our employees: “You have the
right—no, the obligation—to hold your executive team accountable for what
we’re saying our culture should be. If we’re not following through, make an
appointment or send an email. Or just walk up to us in the hallway and tell us
we are not getting it done.”

It took three months for anyone to take us up on our invitation. Our CEO,
Mike Long, engaged with a lunch group and said, “Why would anybody want to
work in an environment with a fear of holding each other accountable?” That
was a powerful inflection point, and people began to believe. But culture change
can be very personal. It took one conversation at a time to convince our
employees that collaboration, shared accountability, and transparency would be
rewarded. And to show they had nothing to fear from the new Lumeris.

HR can be a potent vehicle for operating excellence. It’s also the place
where culture change is crystallized—at the end of the day, culture is about the
people you recruit and the values they bring to bear. While Lumeris had its
share of A and B players in middle management, there were also C players and
below who’d been hired with erroneous criteria and vague interviews. There is
no tool, OKRs included, that will work with the wrong instruction manual.

Time is the enemy of transformation. We took less than eighteen months to
replace 85 percent of our HR professionals. Once senior management and
frontline employees were fully on board, we tackled the tougher nut:
strengthening middle management. That’s typically a three-year process, from
start to steady state. When it’s complete, your new culture is assured.



OBJECTIVE
Institute a culture that attracts and retains A players.

KEY RESULTS
1. Focus on hiring A player managers/leaders.
2. Optimize recruitment function to attract A player talent.
3. Scrub all job descriptions.
4. Retrain everyone engaged in the interviewing process.
5. Ensure ongoing mentoring/coaching opportunities.
6. Create a culture of learning for development of new and

existing employees.

OKR Resurrection
Late in 2015, I asked my HR team to dissect the company’s earlier stab at
OKRs. If we were to make another go of it, we’d need to retrain everybody in
the company—and I meant everybody. We wouldn’t get a third chance.

The following April, we relaunched the platform with a sixty-day pilot program
for a hundred employees in our operations group. Our senior vice president for
operations and delivery, had his doubts going in. But with sharpened training,
plus improvements to the software, he became an enthusiast. Within less than
two weeks, he was shooting emails to the pilot group: Why did you write this
objective that way? What’s the metric here? I don’t get this OKR, it isn’t what I’m
seeing from client feedback. And his people were thinking, He’s paying
attention! I’d better look at this more closely.

Winning our troops over to OKRs wasn’t easy or instantaneous, far from it.
Transparency is scary. Admitting your failures—visibly, publicly—can be
terrifying. We had to rewire people from how they’d been raised since
kindergarten. It’s like your first scuba dive, when you go thirty-five feet down
and the adrenaline is pumping and you’re scared out of your wits. But when you
come back up, you’re exhilarated. You have a new insight into how things work
beneath the surface.

It’s no different plunging into OKRs. Once you start having honest,
vulnerable, two-way conversations with your direct reports, you begin to see
what makes them tick. You feel their yearning to connect to things bigger than
themselves. You hear their need for recognition that what they’re doing matters.
Through the open window of objectives and key results, each of you gets to
know the other’s weaknesses with no worry of getting caught out. (For
managers, one particular benefit of OKRs is to lead them to hires who can
compensate for their own limitations.) Our people stopped dancing around their



setbacks. They began to realize there was no shame in trying your hardest and
failing, not when OKRs help you fail smart and fail fast.

The tide turned. We began hearing comments like “I was a complete
naysayer, but now I see how this can work for me.” Ninety-eight percent of the
pilot group became active users of our OKR platform; 72 percent set at least
one objective aligned to the company’s goals. And 92 percent of the pilot group
said they now understood “what my manager expects of me.”

Transparency Without Judgment
By then I was working with Art Glasgow, who came on board in the spring of
2016 as our president and COO. The two of us agreed there was no point to
OKRs unless we went all the way. Art volunteered to be executive sponsor, our
goal-setting shepherd. He stood up in front of an all-hands meeting and said,
“OKRs are how we’re going to run the company, and we’re going to use them to
measure your bosses.” (That was the carrot that balanced the stick.) Art’s role
in the crusade cannot be overestimated. He set the tone for what he calls
“brutal transparency without judgment.” And he made my job less lonely.

In Q3, as OKRs were rolled out to all 800 Lumeris employees, we created
our own coaches’ training program. Over a period of five weeks, our reinvented
HR department worked overtime to meet with every single manager—more than
250 of them—in classroom-size groups. We held open houses for them to come
and talk to us one-on-one, and we told them up front there were no dumb
questions. Those sessions became a golden opportunity. They were
instrumental in building engagement and motivating people to deliver against
expectations.

Goal setting is more art than science. We weren’t just teaching people how
to refine an objective or a measurable key result. We had a cultural agenda, as
well.

Why is transparency important? Why would you want people across
other departments to know your goals? And why does what we’re doing
matter?
What is true accountability? What’s the difference between
accountability with respect (for others’ failings) and accountability with
vulnerability (for our own)?

How can OKRs help managers “get work done through others”? (That’s
a big factor for scalability in a growing company.) How do we engage
other teams to adopt our objective as a priority and help assure that we
reach it?

When is it time to stretch a team’s workload—or to ease off on the
throttle? When do you shift an objective to a different team member, or



rewrite a goal to make it clearer, or remove it completely? In building
contributors’ confidence, timing is everything.

There is no handbook to address these questions. The wisdom resides in
leaders with personal connections to their teams, to managers who can show
what success looks like and know when to declare victory. (My advice: Not too
soon.)

Our training investment paid dividends. In Q3 of 2016, our people’s first full
crack at the system, 75 percent of them created at least one OKR. Our retention
numbers began moving in the right direction. Lumeris has fewer involuntary
exits these days. We’re hiring the right people and keeping the ones who can
thrive here.

Selling Your Reds
Shortly after arriving, Art held a full-day, off-site business review for the Lumeris
leadership team. Now it’s on the company’s monthly calendar. When our top-
line OKRs are projected on a screen, it’s clear to see which leaders are making
their objectives. Art doesn’t like yellows, so every OKR is either green (on track)
or red (at risk). There’s no bell-curve ambiguity, no place for problems to hide.

The reviews run for three hours, with a dozen senior executives taking their
turn. Little time is spent on people’s greens. Instead, they “sell” their reds. The
team votes on the most important at-risk OKRs for the company as a whole,
then brainstorms together as long as it takes to get the objectives back on track.
In the spirit of cross-departmental solidarity, individuals volunteer to “buy” their
colleagues’ reds. As Art says, “We’re all here to help. We’re all in the same
bathwater.” As far as I know, “selling your reds” is a unique use of OKRs, and
one well worth emulating.

Today’s transformed Lumeris values interdependence. It prizes intentional
coordination. “OKRs make you focus on working on the business, instead of just
working in the business,” says Jeff Smith, senior vice president for U.S.
markets. “Our regional market heads are quarterbacking opportunities versus
running them solo. We’re moving from hero culture to team culture.” Smith was
happily surprised to find the operations and delivery team tying their objectives
directly to Smith’s sales goals. In the past, Smith said, “You’d hear things like,
‘I’m in delivery, you’re in sales, just do your damn job.’ Now it’s more like calling
in a wide receiver to run a play: ‘I’m here, let me help you.’ That was a result of
the OKR process I never expected.”

First, Lumeris needed to nurture the right culture for OKRs to take root. Then
it needed OKRs to sustain and deepen that new culture, to help it win people’s
hearts and minds. That’s a campaign that never ends.

By all the metrics, 2017 was a banner year for Lumeris, now the
market leader for value-based care. “The market’s starting to shift,”
Art Glasgow told me. “For the first time I feel like our sales plan
could start to get realistic. I might actually have to put in some
stretch goals.”

As of this writing, Lumeris has launched partnerships with
payers, provider groups, and health systems in eighteen states,
accounting for more than one million lives. The potential is
staggering. If adopted nationwide, the company’s Missouri model
could save up to $800 billion annually in wasteful medical
expenditures. Most important, it would enhance our nation’s quality
and quantity of life.

At today’s Lumeris, OKRs are part of the wallpaper. As Andrew
Cole might say: Once people experienced the new company under
the surface, they couldn’t resist the temptation to keep diving back
into it.

Culture Change: Bono’s ONE
Campaign Story

Bono
Cofounder

W e’ve just seen how OKRs can lock in culture change post
hoc. As Bono’s story shows structured goal setting can also
springboard an enriching cultural reset.

For nearly two decades, the world’s biggest rock star has waged
“an experiment in anti-apathy on a global scale.” Bono’s first Big
Hairy Audacious Goal came out of the Jubilee 2000 global
initiative, which led to $100 billion in debt relief for the world’s
poorest countries. Two years later, with a start-up grant from the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bono cofounded DATA (Debt,
AIDS, Trade, Africa), a global advocacy organization for public
policy change. Its declared mission was to address poverty, disease,
and development in Africa in alliance with government bodies and
other multinational NGOs. (Bill Gates would say it was the best
million dollars he ever spent.) In 2004, Bono launched the ONE
Campaign to catalyze a nonpartisan, grassroots, activist coalition.
It’s the outside-facing complement to DATA’s inside game.

From the time we first met, I was struck by Bono’s passion for
“factivism,” or fact-based activism. In ONE’s hardheaded,
analytical, results-oriented environment, OKRs were an easy sell.
For the last ten years, they’ve helped clarify the organization’s
priorities—a tall order when your mission is to change the world.
According to David Lane, the organization’s former CEO, “We
needed a process of discipline to keep us from trying to do
everything.”



As ONE has grown, it has leaned on OKRs to achieve
fundamental culture change. It is pivoting from working on Africa
to working in and with Africa. As David told me, “There’s been a
dramatic philosophical change in how people think about helping
the developing world develop itself, to empower these countries to
grow on their own. OKRs played a key role in how we did that.”

To improve the lives of the world’s most vulnerable, ONE has
helped deliver nearly $50 billion in funding for historic health
initiatives. In addition, it has lobbied successfully for transparency
rules to fight corruption, and to channel resources from African oil
and gas revenues into the war on extreme poverty. In 2005,
alongside Bill and Melinda Gates, Bono was named Time
magazine’s Person of the Year.

Bono: We had big goals for U2 from the start. (You could say megalomania set
in from a very early age.) Edge was already an accomplished guitar player and
Larry was a pretty good drummer, but I was a poor singer and Adam really
couldn’t play the bass at all. But here’s what we thought: We’re not as good as
those other groups. So we better be better.

We weren’t as polished or accomplished as the bands we’d go and see, but
we had chemistry, whatever the thing is that makes it magic. We thought we
could blow up the world if we didn’t blow ourselves up first. We felt we could go
all the way. The other bands had everything, but we had it. That’s what we used
to repeat to ourselves.

How did we measure effectiveness? Well, at the outset, we asked questions
about our place in the world, beyond the pop charts or the clubs. Like: Can our
music be useful? Can art inspire political change? In 1979, when we were just
eighteen, one of our first jobs was an anti-apartheid show. Another was a pro-
contraception show—in Ireland, that was a big deal. Later, in our early twenties,
we deliberately became a nuisance to what you might call Irish terror groups
and all the people who felt ambivalent about them. We felt compelled to say that
blowing up kids in supermarkets can never be right. We gauged our political
impact by the torrent of bile that came back at us.



U2’s 360 Tour, 2009.

And then at some point, you want your songs to chart. We worked quite hard
to break through to the mainstream, actually. We were a live phenomenon, but
our singles didn’t do very well. So we judged our success by selling tickets, and
then by selling albums.

Picking Our Fights
When we formed our nonprofit DATA, we went about it exactly the same as I
had with U2. It was a band: Lucy Matthew, Bobby Shriver, Jamie Drummond,
and myself. We didn’t know who was the singer or the bass player or the
drummer or the guitar player. But we knew we weren’t a bunch of hippies and
wishful thinkers. We were more punk rock. We were tough-minded opportunists.
We were working on a single idea: debt cancellation for the poorest countries.
We were good at that, choosing one fight at a time and going at it with a vicious
schedule.

Then we went after universal access to anti-AIDS drugs, another clear goal,
and I must say, people did laugh in our face: “You are out of your tiny mind.
That’s impossible. Why fight the most expensive disease when you could have
a go at malaria or river blindness? Or finish off polio?”

And I remember saying, “No, we’re picking a fight with this disease because
these two pills”—it’s one pill now—“are a visual representation of inequality. If



you live in Dublin or Palo Alto, you can get the pills. If you live in Lilongwe,
Malawi, in Africa, you can’t get the pills. So because of an accident of longitude
and latitude, you live or you die. That doesn’t feel right.”

Anyway, I was sure we could win that argument, because everyone knew
such inequality was wrong. It was that simple. That was years before we used
OKRs, but even then I used to say, “Picture Everest, then describe how difficult
the climb is. Then describe how we’re going to reach the summit.” Like Everest,
beating AIDS looked nearly impossible. First you needed to be able to describe
it. Then you could climb it.

So now it’s 2017, and 21 million people are accessing the antiretroviral
therapies. It’s amazing. And AIDS-related deaths are down 45 percent in the
last ten years. New HIV infections in children are down by more than half. And
we’re on pace to win the fight against mother-to-child transmission by 2020, to
finish the disease off. I believe we will live to see an AIDS-free world in our
lifetime.

Growing Up with OKRs
Our NGO band was entrepreneurial in spirit, and we tracked our goals
internally. But you can only go so far without process. Once we started to have
real impact and real access, DATA merited more data—more measurable
procedures, more measurable outcomes. Then we brought eleven different
groups together to form a coalition behind the ONE Campaign. We had so
many brilliant, gifted people, but our problem was way too many goals. A green
revolution in Africa. Girls’ education. Energy poverty. Global warming. We were
all over the map.

DATA and ONE merged two very different cultures—it was tricky. We
realized we were ourselves lacking in transparency. If you don’t have clear sign-
offs to your goals, you get overlap and dissonance. People get confused about
their jobs. For a time we had a real schism in our organization.

Here’s the thing: We never thought small. The stretch was always there. But
our goals were so gigantic that we stretched too thin and got people worn out.
OKRs saved us, really. Tom Freston, chairman of ONE’s board, saw their value,
so they became part and parcel of the operation—he played a very important
role. OKRs forced us to think clearly and agree on what we could achieve with
the resources we had. They gave us a frame to hang our passion on. And you
need that framework because, without it, your brain is just too abstract. The
OKR traffic lights, the color coding—they transformed our board meetings. They
sharpened our strategy, our execution, our results. They made us a more
effective weapon in the fight against extreme poverty.



The Pivot
When John Doerr arrived at our very first ONE board meeting, he asked a
simple and profound question: “Who are we working for? Who’s the client
here?”

We said, “John, we’re working for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.”
And John said, “Well, then, do they have a seat at the table?”

We said, “Of course, the whole table’s there for them.”
But John persisted, which was important: “Can you visualize that person?

Shouldn’t we think about them physically being at this table?”
That’s the thinking that seeded the pivot that eventually transformed our

organization ONE. John’s prodding rhymed with a man we met in Paris once, a
man from Senegal. He said, “Bono, do you know the Senegalese proverb ‘If you
want to cut a man’s hair, it is better if he is in the room’?” He said it in a loving
way, but we didn’t miss the message: Be careful if you think you know what we
want. Because we know what we want. You’re not African, and this messiah
complex hasn’t always turned out so well.

In 2002, in southeast Africa, I had seen people with HIV queuing up to die.
Along with many other AIDS activists, I sent up dramatic flares about the scale
and devastation of this pandemic. I encouraged everyone in our organization
never to say the word AIDS without adding the word emergency. “The AIDS
emergency.” By 2009, though, there was backlash. Some more well-heeled
Africans took exception to the way we were characterizing AIDS, though we
were right. An economist named Dambisa Moyo wrote a book called Dead Aid
and led the charge among those who were thinking, “Shove your aid. We don’t
need it. It’s doing more damage than good. We’re trying to rebrand the
continent as a positive place to invest and live and work. You’re hurting that.”

I could see that ONE’s credibility was under threat here. We had focused on
governments in the North because decisions in Washington, London, and Berlin
had big consequences for many of the poorest countries. Jamie and other
activist friends, like John Githongo, Ory Okolloh, and Rakesh Rajani, were on
the ground reminding us of the same thing. Africa’s future had to be decided by
Africans. We had called our organization ONE, yet we were only half the people
necessary to fix these problems. It was fantasy to think those north of the
equator could end extreme poverty without a full partnership with those south of
the equator.

ONE committed to both organizational and cultural change. Even now, we’re
still increasing our collaborative work with African leaders—grassroots, grass
tops, and all in between. We’ve established a growing African office in
Johannesburg and around the continent. The OKRs have kept us focused on
the concrete changes we need to make—hiring staff in Africa, expanding our
board, reconnecting with old Jubilee partners, and identifying new networks to
turn to for advice. I guess we’ve become better listeners. And I don’t think we
could have done it without objectives and key results.



OBJECTIVE
Proactively integrate a broad range of African

perspectives into ONE’s work, align more closely with
African priorities, and share and leverage ONE’s political
capital to achieve specific policy changes in and toward

Africa.

KEY RESULTS
1. Three African-based hires complete and onboard by

April, and two African board members approved by July.
2. African Advisory Board in place by July and convened

twice by December.
3. Relationships fully developed with a minimum of ten to

fifteen leading African thinkers who actively and
regularly challenge and guide ONE’s policy positions
and external work.

4. Undertake four participatory trips to Africa over the
course of 2010.

Measuring Passion
Having Sudanese businessman and philanthropist Mo Ibrahim on our board is
just transformative. In Africa, he is the real deal, a proper rock star. He and his
daughter, Hadeel, give us the intellectual static on the continent that we were
missing—and that was so necessary to tune in to stronger channels. Before we
met him, Mo was properly rude about some of our objectives. He steered us to
transparency as a central goal—not just in Africa, but in Europe and America.
We put in the research and found that corruption drains a trillion dollars a year
from developing countries. “This is more important than HIV/AIDS,” Mo told us.
“This will save more lives.”

With the impetus coming from Africans, ONE’s change has progressed. We
lobbied side by side with the Publish What You Pay collective, and now it is
illegal for any company on the New York Stock Exchange or in the EU to
conceal what they’ve paid for mining rights. And last year, Aliko Dangote, whom
I’ve heard dubbed the Bill Gates of Africa, joined the board.

That’s all well and good, but we’ve also got to be straight about the facts. For
example: As of December 2017, ONE has 8.9 million members who have
signed up online or have taken part in at least one action. (Over three million of
them are now in Africa.) And I can see Bill Gates rolling his eyes and saying,
“Big deal. Signers are not members. They’re just people who sign something.”
He’s correct, of course. But that led us to a question: How do we measure



membership engagement? And whatever metric we come up with, is the
number static or can it grow? We needed to prove that we could take people
from signers to members to activists to catalysts, so we found ways to thank
and reward our members for doing more than one action. We flooded the
districts of certain U.S. senators and congresspeople, and it became unnerving
for them. For example, if you ask Kay Granger, a Republican congresswoman
from Texas, she probably thinks there are people in ONE T-shirts everywhere,
pressing her to take a stand. But we’re not everywhere; she was one of our
strategic targets. And she really came through for ONE.

Bono brings the ONE Campaign to Dalori, Nigeria, to visit internally displaced
persons camps, 2016.

Nobody has ever before measured activists’ passion. It sounds odd, but it’s
totally OKR. So you’re passionate—how passionate? What actions does your
passion lead you to do? And now when Bill Gates asks tough questions at our
board meeting, we can bring out our OKRs and say, “Here is what we’ve done,
and this is the impact it’s had.”

An OKR Framework
Is there a downside to OKRs? Well, if you read them incorrectly, I suppose you
could get too organized. ONE mustn’t get institutional; we need to stay



disruptive. I’m always scared that we’re going to go corporate and try to beat
every quarterly goal. We needed John to remind us, “If everything’s at green,
you failed.” That was counterintuitive for a lot of people, especially now that
we’re financed up and have the best and the brightest working here. But John
kept saying, “More red!” He was right. We needed more big ambitions because
that’s what we’re good at. We’re less good at the incremental stuff.

ONE isn’t standing on our passion. We’re not standing on our moral outrage.
We’re standing on a foundation built on certain principles, and with walls and
floors—with a certain structure of thinking from the OKRs. And for that, we are
very, very grateful. It takes intellectual rigor to effect change; it requires very
serious strategies, indeed. If the heart doesn’t find a perfect rhyme with the
head, then your passion means nothing. The OKR framework cultivates the
madness, the chemistry contained inside it. It gives us an environment for risk,
for trust, where failing is not a fireable offense—you know, a safe place to be
yourself. And when you have that sort of structure and environment, and the
right people, magic is around the corner.

And so: Edge was a really talented guitar player from the start, but I wasn’t
the best singer. Adam wasn’t the best bass player. And Larry was just getting
there as a drummer. But we had our goals, and a rough idea of how to reach
them. We wanted to be the best band in the world.

The Goals to Come

What keeps me going is goals.
—Muhammad Ali

I deas are easy; execution is everything.
If you have read this far, you’ve seen how OKRs and CFRs

help organizations of all stripes and sizes move mountains.
You’ve heard firsthand accounts of how they inspire workers,
develop leaders, and unify teams to do great things. By measuring
what matters, objectives and key results are helping Bono and the
Gates Foundation mobilize against poverty and disease in Africa.
They’re driving Google in its audacious 10x quest to make the
world’s information freely accessible to all. They’re empowering the
pizza savants at Zume to deliver a robotically assembled artisanal
pie, hot and fresh, to your door.

And here’s what’s exciting: I think we’re just getting started.
OKRs may be called a tool, or a protocol, or a process. But my

image of choice is a launch pad, a point of liftoff for the next wave of
entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs. My dream is to see Andy Grove’s
brainchild transform every walk of life. I believe it can have a huge
impact on GDP growth, health care outcomes, school success,
government performance, business results, and social progress.
We’re getting glimpses of that future through forward thinkers like
Orly Friedman, who has introduced OKRs to every elementary
schoolchild at the Khan Lab School in Mountain View, California.
(Imagine you are five or six years old and setting your own goals for
learning—your own objectives and key results!—as you learn to
reason and read.)



I’m convinced that if structured goal setting and continuous
communication were to be widely deployed, with rigor and
imagination, we could see exponentially greater productivity and
innovation throughout society.

OKRs have such enormous potential because they are so
adaptable. There is no dogma, no one right way to use them.
Different organizations have fluctuating needs at various phases of
their life cycle. For some, the simple act of making goals open and
transparent is a big leap forward. For others, a quarterly planning
cadence will change the game. It’s up to you to find your points of
emphasis and to make the tool your own.

This book tells a handful of behind-the-scenes stories of OKRs
and CFRs. Thousands more are just getting started or have yet to be
told. Moving forward, we’re going to continue this conversation at
whatmatters.com. Come see us there. And you can join the
discussion by emailing me at john@whatmatters.com.

My ultimate stretch OKR is to empower people to achieve the
seemingly impossible together. To create durable cultures for
success and significance. And to prime the pump of inspiration for
all the goals—especially your goals—that matter most.



DEDICATION

T his book is dedicated to two extraordinary people who left us,
too soon, within a span of four weeks in 2016. Andy Grove,
the brilliant originator of the OKR, is remembered in fair

detail in these pages. “Coach” Bill Campbell’s wisdom is invoked
more fleetingly. Here, then, is our opportunity to celebrate Bill, a
man who gave so much to so many. From his gift for honest, open
communication to his zeal for data-driven operating excellence, the
Coach embodied the very spirit of OKRs. So it’s only fitting that he
graces our close.

On that clear April morning in Atherton, California, it took a big
tent to hold Bill’s funeral mass on the Sacred Heart playing fields,
the place he’d spent so many Saturdays coaching eighth-graders in
flag football or softball. More than three thousand mourners turned
out, from Larry Page and Jeff Bezos to generations of the (once)
young people who’d played for him. Bill had embraced every one of
us with his unabashed bear hugs and selfless guidance. And every
one of us believed that Bill was our best friend. His life was the
biggest tent of all.

The son of a gym teacher who worked nights at the steel mill in
Homestead, Pennsylvania, Bill first earned his sobriquet in the
1970s as varsity football coach at his adored alma mater, Columbia
University.* But Coach became the Coach when he traded the
gridiron for an even more competitive arena, namely the
boardrooms and executive suites of Silicon Valley. He was a world-
class listener, a hall-of-fame mentor, and the wisest man I’ve ever
met. His ambitious, caring, accountable, transparent, profane
humanity built the culture at Google—and dozens of other
companies—to what it is today.

As Ken Auletta wrote in The New Yorker, “In the world capital of
engineering, where per-capita income can seem inversely related to
social skills, Campbell was the man who taught founders to look up
from their computer screens. . . . His obituary was not featured on



the front of most newspapers, or at the top of most technology news
sites, but it should have been.”

—
We first met in the late eighties. I was recruiting a CEO for one of
my most famous failed ventures, the GO Corporation, a pen-based
tablet computer company. (Bill’s joke was that we should have
called it “GO, Going, Gone.”) He came recommended by Debra
Radabaugh, the top executive recruiter in Silicon Valley, and by his
old marketing boss at Apple, Floyd Kvamme, whom I’d recruited to
Kleiner Perkins. The deal was sealed when I visited Bill’s team at
Claris, the Apple software subsidiary. I’m usually quick to judge
whether I’m ready to get into trouble with an entrepreneur, though
it may take a while longer to persuade them to get into trouble with
me. Claris had such great esprit de corps, and such obvious esteem
for Bill, that I was sold on the spot.

2010.

When Apple and John Sculley refused to spin off Claris in an
IPO, as Bill believed had been promised, he took the job at GO.



Though our business model flopped, we had a fabulous time
together. Before Bill, GO’s executive team would preface every vote
with a heated argument over strategy, making for winners, losers,
and general hard feelings. After Bill became CEO, all of that
changed. He’d sit with individual executives and ask them about
their families, and tell a story or two in his colloquial way, and
gradually he’d learn how they felt about the issue at hand. He had a
remarkable way of getting people to agree in advance before they
came into the room, and soon there was no more voting at GO. For
Bill, it was always about the team, the company. He was devoid of
private motives or agendas. The mission was paramount.

Bill was a master leader who developed great leaders. Five of his
direct reports at GO became CEOs or CBOs of their own ventures. (I
backed every one of them, and every one of them turned a profit.)
Among many lessons, Bill taught us the importance of a team’s
dignity, especially when a company fails. After GO sold out to AT&T,
we made sure that those who were let go had great references and
found good homes for their careers.

In 1994, I brought Bill back with me to Kleiner Perkins as an
“executive in residence,” installed him in the corner office next to
mine, and promised to find another company for him to run.
Around the same time, Intuit founder Scott Cook decided to hire a
CEO. Once I introduced Bill to Scott, it took them one walk around
Bill’s neighborhood in Palo Alto for the Coach to get the job. He and
Scott built a tremendous relationship and a spectacular company.

Early in Bill’s four-year Intuit tenure, he faced a crisis. Revenues
were lagging to the point where they were going to miss the quarter.
We had a blue-sky, visionary board of directors that was pushing to
invest more capital and power through the shortfall. When the
board met in a hotel suite in Las Vegas, the Coach wasn’t buying it.
“Cut the crap,” he said. “We’re going to cut back and lay some
people off. We’re going to get leaner because we’ve got to make the
numbers. It’s part of the discipline and the culture I want.” Bill felt
strongly about delivering results—for the shareholders, but also for
the team and the customers.

As we polled the room, however, more and more directors came
out for spending and plowing through. Bill looked more and more
distraught. When it came around to me, I said, “You know, I think
we should go with the Coach.” I wasn’t sure if he was right or wrong,
but I thought it was rightfully his call. My position turned the tide.



Later, Bill told me how much what I’d said had meant to him, and
that he might have resigned had it gone the other way.

From that point on, we had an unbreakable bond. We could
disagree and say some pretty harsh things, but the next day one or
the other would call to apologize. Both of us understood that our
loyalty—to the relationship, to the team—outweighed any
differences.

Bill was still at Intuit when I recruited him for the board at
Netscape. Soon he was my first call whenever I backed a new
entrepreneur. It became our MO: Kleiner invests, Doerr sponsors,
Doerr calls Campbell, Campbell coaches the team. We ran that game
plan again and again.

In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the most amazing
nonhostile takeover of a public company ever, without putting up a
penny. Steve asked for the resignations of all but one of Apple’s
directors, and then he called Bill Campbell to join his new board.
The Coach refused to be paid for this work; he was giving back to
the Valley that had done so much for him. When a few companies
prevailed upon him to accept stock, he funneled the proceeds into
his philanthropic organization.

In 2001, after helping persuade Google’s founders to hire Eric
Schmidt as CEO, I advised Eric that he needed Bill as his coach. Eric
was a rightfully proud man who’d already served as CEO and
chairman at Novell, and my suggestion offended him—“I know what
I’m doing,” he said. So it wasn’t love at first sight for him and Bill.
But in less than a year, Eric’s self-review showed how far he’d come
around: “Bill Campbell has been very helpful in coaching all of us.
In hindsight, his role was needed from the beginning. I should have
encouraged this structure sooner, ideally the moment I started at
Google.”

Bill considered his Google mandate open-ended. He coached
Larry Page and Sergey Brin—and Susan Wojcicki and Sheryl
Sandberg and Jonathan Rosenberg and Google’s whole executive
team. He did it in his characteristic style, one part Zen and one part
Bud Light. Bill gave little direction. He’d ask a very few questions,
invariably the right ones. But mostly he listened. He knew that most
times in business there were several right answers, and the leader’s
job was to pick one. “Just make a decision,” he’d say. Or: “Are you
moving forward? Are you breaking ties? Let’s keep rolling.”



When it came to Google’s OKRs, Bill paid closest attention to the
less glamorous, “committed” objectives. (A favorite piece of
coaching, served with his typical dash of salt: “You’ve got to make
the f—ing trains run on time.”) As Google CEO Sundar Pichai
recalls, “He cared about operating excellence day in, day out.” It
went back to Bill’s deceptively modest-sounding motto: “Be better
every day.” There is nothing more challenging—or more fulfilling—
than that.

The Coach was the éminence grise at Google’s Monday executive
staff meetings—our unofficial chairman of the board, if you want to
know the truth. At the same time, he served as lead outside director
on Apple’s board, which for anyone else might have presented a
conflict. It drove Steve Jobs crazy, especially after Android emerged
to challenge the iPhone. Steve harangued Bill forever to choose
Apple and leave Google, but the Coach refused: “Steve, I’m not
helping Google with their technology. I can’t even spell HTML. I’m
just helping them be a better business every day.” When Steve
persisted, the Coach said, “Don’t make me choose. You are not
going to like the choice I’m going to make.” And Steve backed down
because the Coach was his one true confidant. (He “kept Steve Jobs
going,” as Eric Schmidt told Forbes. Bill was Steve’s “mentor, his
friend. He was the protector, the inspiration. Steve trusted him
more than he trusted anybody else.”)

Though the Coach knew more about technology than he let on,
he’d never big-foot engineers or product developers. His superb
insights were about leadership, about what made business teams
and people tick—and how to protect your people from getting
steamrolled by your process. If he saw someone treated unfairly,
he’d pick up the phone and call the CEO and say, “This was a
process error.” And he’d fix it.

People are discouraged from bringing love into business settings,
but love was Bill’s most distinguishing trait. I can still picture
everybody’s face lighting up when he’d walk into a meeting at Intuit.
Sometimes it was love by faux insult. (If you came to work in an ugly
sweater, he’d ask, “Did you roll some guy in the restroom to get that
thing?”) But you always knew the Coach cared. You always knew he
had your back. You always knew he was there for the team. You
don’t find many leaders who can convey love and fearless feedback
at the same time. Bill Campbell was a tough coach, but he was
always a players’ coach.



More than most in our circles, he got family. He was absolutely
the happiest when out coaching his daughter Maggie (and my
daughter Mary) in softball. He’d be on the field at 3:20 sharp, no
matter what big meeting was starting someplace else. And you’d
never find the Coach distractedly checking his cell phone in the
sixth inning. He was completely present. He sparkled in that setting.

Even after he got sick, Bill never stopped coaching. When I
decided to take on the chairmanship of Kleiner Perkins, his advice
was a big factor. With my two daughters off to college, the time was
right. The Coach knew I wouldn’t be slowing down or moving
“upstairs.” I’d take the job to accelerate what I loved doing: finding
and funding the best entrepreneurs, and helping them build great
teams as they scaled. It was my chance to become a player-coach for
the next generation of leaders and partners. To follow Bill’s lead.

A few months before he died, in a podcast with my Kleiner
partner Randy Komisar, the Coach explained that he “always
wanted to be part of the solution. . . . People are the most important
thing that we do. We have to try to make them better.”

Bill is gone, but for his many hundreds of disciples, all the
executives he coached over all those years, his work goes on. We’re
still trying to get better every day.

I miss you, Coach. We all do.

RESOURCE 1

Google’s OKR Playbook

No one has more collective experience in implementing OKRs than
Google. As the company has scaled (and scaled), it has periodically
issued OKR guidelines and templates. The following excerpts are
drawn mostly from internal sources and reprinted with Google’s
permission. (Note: This is Google’s approach to OKRs. Your
approach may—and should—differ.)

—
At Google, we like to think big. We use a process called objectives
and key results (OKRs) to help us communicate, measure, and
achieve those lofty goals.

Our actions determine Google’s future. As we’ve seen repeatedly
—in Search, in Chrome, in Android—a team composed of a few
percent of the company’s workforce, acting in concert toward an
ambitious common goal, can change an entire mature industry in
less than two years. Thus it is crucial that as Google employees and
managers we make conscious, careful, and informed choices about
how we allocate our time and energy—as individuals and as
members of teams. OKRs are the manifestation of those careful
choices, and the means by which we coordinate the actions of
individuals to achieve great collective goals.

We use OKRs to plan what people are going to produce, track
their progress vs. plan, and coordinate priorities and milestones
between people and teams. We also use OKRs to help people stay
focused on the most important goals, and help them avoid being
distracted by urgent but less important goals.

OKRs are big, not incremental—we don’t expect to hit all of them.
(If we do, we’re not setting them aggressively enough.) We grade
them with a color scale to measure how well we did:

0.0–0.3 is red



0.4–0.6 is yellow
0.7–1.0 is green

Writing Effective OKRs

Poorly done/managed OKRs are a waste of time, an empty
management gesture. Well done OKRs are a motivational
management tool that helps make it clear to teams what’s
important, what to optimize, and what tradeoffs to make during
their day-to-day work.

Writing good OKRs isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible, either. Pay
attention to the following simple rules:

Objectives are the “Whats.” They:
express goals and intents;

are aggressive yet realistic;
must be tangible, objective, and unambiguous; should be
obvious to a rational observer whether an objective has
been achieved.

The successful achievement of an objective must provide
clear value for Google.

Key Results are the “Hows.” They:
express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will
advance objective(s) in a useful manner to their
constituents;
must describe outcomes, not activities. If your KRs include
words like “consult,” “help,” “analyze,” or “participate,”
they describe activities. Instead, describe the end-user
impact of these activities: “publish average and tail latency
measurements from six Colossus cells by March 7,” rather
than “assess Colossus latency”;



must include evidence of completion. This evidence must
be available, credible, and easily discoverable. Examples of
evidence include change lists, links to docs, notes, and
published metrics reports.

Cross-team OKRs

Many important projects at Google require contribution from
different groups. OKRs are ideally suited to commit to this
coordination. Cross-team OKRs should include all the groups who
must materially participate in the OKR, and OKRs committing to
each group’s contribution should appear explicitly in each such
group’s OKRs. For example, if Ads Development and Ads SRE and
Network Deployment must deliver to support a new ads service,
then all three teams should have OKRs describing their
commitment to deliver their part of the project.

Committed vs. Aspirational OKRs

OKRs have two variants, and it is important to differentiate between
them:

Commitments are OKRs that we agree will be achieved, and we
will be willing to adjust schedules and resources to ensure that they
are delivered.

The expected score for a committed OKR is 1.0; a score of
less than 1.0 requires explanation for the miss, as it shows
errors in planning and/or execution.

By contrast, aspirational OKRs express how we’d like the world
to look, even though we have no clear idea how to get there and/or
the resources necessary to deliver the OKR.

Aspirational OKRs have an expected average score of 0.7,
with high variance.



Classic OKR-Writing Mistakes and Traps

TRAP #1: Failing to differentiate between committed and aspirational
OKRs.

Marking a committed OKR as aspirational increases the
chance of failure. Teams may not take it seriously and may
not change their other priorities to focus on delivering the
OKR.
On the other hand, marking an aspirational OKR as
committed creates defensiveness in teams who cannot find
a way to deliver the OKR, and it invites priority inversion as
committed OKRs are de-staffed to focus on the aspirational
OKR.

TRAP #2: Business-as-usual OKRs.
OKRs are often written principally based on what the team
believes it can achieve without changing anything they’re
currently doing, as opposed to what the team or its
customers really want.

TRAP #3: Timid aspirational OKRs.
Aspirational OKRs very often start from the current state
and effectively ask, “What could we do if we had extra staff
and got a bit lucky?” An alternative and better approach is
to start with, “What could my [or my customers’] world
look like in several years if we were freed from most
constraints?” By definition, you’re not going to know how
to achieve this state when the OKR is first formulated—that
is why it is an aspirational OKR. But without understanding
and articulating the desired end state, you guarantee that
you are not going to be able to achieve it.

The litmus test: If you ask your customers what they really
want, does your aspirational objective meet or exceed their
request?

TRAP #4: Sandbagging.
A team’s committed OKRs should credibly consume most
but not all of their available resources. Their committed +
aspirational OKRs should credibly consume somewhat



more than their available resources. (Otherwise they’re
effectively commits.)

Teams who can meet all of their OKRs without needing all
of their team’s headcount/capital . . . are assumed to either
be hoarding resources or not pushing their teams, or both.
This is a cue for senior management to reassign headcount
and other resources to groups who will make more effective
use of them.

TRAP #5: Low Value Objectives (aka the “Who cares?” OKR). OKRs
must promise clear business value—otherwise, there’s no reason to
expend resources doing them. Low Value Objectives (LVOs) are
those for which, even if the Objective is completed with a 1.0, no one
will notice or care.

A classic (and seductive) LVO example: “Increase task CPU
utilization by 3 percent.” This objective by itself does not
help users or Google directly. However, the (presumably
related) goal, “Decrease quantity of cores required to serve
peak queries by 3 percent with no change to
quality/latency/ . . . and return resulting excess cores to the
free pool” has clear economic value. That’s a superior
objective.

Here is a litmus test: Could the OKR get a 1.0 under
reasonable circumstances without providing direct end-
user or economic benefit? If so, then reword the OKR to
focus on the tangible benefit. A classic example: “Launch
X,” with no criteria for success. Better: “Double fleet-wide Y
by launching X to 90+ percent of borg cells.”

TRAP #6: Insufficient KRs for committed Os.
OKRs are divided into the desired outcome (the objective)
and the measurable steps required to achieve that outcome
(the key results). It is critical that KRs are written such that
scoring 1.0 on all key results generates a 1.0 score for the
objective.

A common error is writing key results that are necessary
but not sufficient to collectively complete the objective. The
error is tempting because it allows a team to avoid the



difficult (resource/priority/risk) commitments needed to
deliver “hard” key results.

This trap is particularly pernicious because it delays both
the discovery of the resource requirements for the
objective, and the discovery that the objective will not be
completed on schedule.
The litmus test: Is it reasonably possible to score 1.0 on all
the key results but still not achieve the intent of the
objective? If so, add or rework the key results until their
successful completion guarantees that the objective is also
successfully completed.

Reading, Interpreting, and Acting on OKRs

For committed OKRs
Teams are expected to rearrange their other priorities to
ensure an on-schedule 1.0 delivery.

Teams who cannot credibly promise to deliver a 1.0 on a
committed OKR must escalate promptly. This is a key point:
Escalating in this (common) situation is not only OK, it is
required. Whether the issue arose because of disagreement
about the OKR, disagreement about its priority, or inability
to allocate enough time/people/resources, escalation is good.
It allows the team’s management to develop options and
resolve conflicts.

The corollary is that every new OKR is likely to involve some
amount of escalation, since it requires a change to existing
priorities and commitments. An OKR that requires no changes
to any group’s activities is a business-as-usual OKR, and those
are unlikely to be new—although they may not have previously
been written down.

A committed OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date
requires a postmortem. This is not intended to punish teams.
It is intended to understand what occurred in the planning



and/or execution of the OKR, so that teams may improve
their ability to reliably hit 1.0 on committed OKRs.

Examples of classes of committed OKRs are ensuring that a
service meets its SLA (service level agreement) for the
quarter; or delivering a defined feature or improvement to an
infrastructure system by a set date; or manufacturing and
delivering a quantity of servers at a cost point.

Aspirational OKRs
The set of aspirational OKRs will by design exceed the team’s
ability to execute in a given quarter. The OKRs’ priority
should inform team members’ decisions on where to spend
the remaining time they have after the group’s commitments
are met. In general, higher priority OKRs should be
completed before lower priority OKRs.

Aspirational OKRs and their associated priorities should
remain on a team’s OKR list until they are completed,
carrying them forward from quarter to quarter as necessary.
Dropping them from the OKR list because of lack of progress
is a mistake, as it disguises persistent problems of
prioritization, resource availability, or a lack of
understanding of the problem/solution.

Corollary: It is good to move an aspirational OKR to a
different team’s list if that team has both the expertise and
bandwidth to accomplish the OKR more effectively than the
current OKR owner.

Team managers are expected to assess the resources required
to accomplish their aspirational OKRs and ask for them each
quarter, fulfilling their duty to express known demand to the
business. Managers should not expect to receive all the
required resources, however, unless their aspirational OKRs
are the highest priority goals in the company after the
committed OKRs.

More Litmus Tests



Some simple tests to see if your OKRs are good:
If you wrote them down in five minutes, they probably aren’t
good. Think.

If your objective doesn’t fit on one line, it probably isn’t crisp
enough.

If your KRs are expressed in team-internal terms (“Launch
Foo 4.1”), they probably aren’t good. What matters isn’t the
launch, but its impact. Why is Foo 4.1 important? Better:
“Launch Foo 4.1 to improve sign-ups by 25 percent.” Or
simply: “Improve sign-ups by 25 percent.”

Use real dates. If every key result happens on the last day of
the quarter, you likely don’t have a real plan.

Make sure your key results are measurable: It must be
possible to objectively assign a grade at the end of the
quarter. “Improve sign-ups” isn’t a good key result. Better:
“Improve daily sign-ups by 25 percent by May 1.”

Make sure the metrics are unambiguous. If you say “1 million
users,” is that all-time users or seven-day actives?

If there are important activities on your team (or a significant
fraction of its effort) that aren’t covered by OKRs, add more.

For larger groups, make OKRs hierarchical—have high-level
ones for the entire team, more detailed ones for subteams.
Make sure that the “horizontal” OKRs (projects that need
multiple teams to contribute) have supporting key results in
each subteam.



RESOURCE 2

A Typical OKR Cycle

Let’s assume you are setting OKRs at the company, team, and contributor levels. (Larger
companies may have additional levels.)

4–6 weeks before quarter

Brainstorm Annual and Q1 OKRs for Company
Senior leaders start brainstorming top-line company OKRs. If you’re setting OKRs for Q1, this
is also the time to set your annual plan, which can help guide the direction of company.

2 weeks before quarter

Communicate Company-wide OKRs for Upcoming Year and Q1
Finalize company OKRs and communicate them to everyone.

Start of quarter

Communicate Team Q1 OKRs
Based on the company’s OKRs, teams develop their own OKRs and share them at their
meetings.

1 week after Start of quarter

Share Employee Q1 OKRs
One week after team OKRs are communicated, contributors share their own OKRs. This may
require negotiation between contributors and their managers, typically in one-on-one settings.

Throughout quarter

Employees Track Progress and Check-in



Throughout the quarter, employees measure and share their progress, checking in regularly
with their managers.
Periodically through the quarter, contributors assess how likely they are to fully achieve their
OKRs. If attainment appears unlikely, they may need to recalibrate.

Near end of quarter

Employees Reflect and Score Q1 OKRs
Toward the end of the quarter, contributors score their OKRs, perform a self-assessment, and
reflect on what they have accomplished.



RESOURCE 3

All Talk: Performance Conversations

Continuous performance management is a two-part, interwoven
process. The first part consists of setting OKRs; the second entails
regular and ongoing conversations, tailored to your needs.

Goal Planning and Reflection

To help facilitate this conversation, a manager might ask a
contributor the following:

What OKRs do you plan to focus on to drive the greatest
value for your role, your team, and/or the company?

Which of these OKRs aligns to key initiatives in the
organization?

Progress Updates

To get the contributor talking, a manager might pose these
questions:

How are your OKRs coming along?

What critical capabilities do you need to be successful?

Is there anything stopping you from attaining your
objectives?



What OKRs need to be adjusted—or added, or eliminated—
in light of shifting priorities?

Manager-led Coaching

To prepare for this conversation, the manager should consider the
following questions:

What behaviors or values do I want my report to continue
to exhibit?
What behaviors or values do I want the report to start or
stop exhibiting?

What coaching can I provide to help the report fully realize
his or her potential?
During the conversation, the leader might ask:

What part of your job most excites you?
What (if any) aspect of your role would you like to
change?

Upward Feedback

To elicit candid input from a contributor, the manager might ask:

What are you getting from me that you find helpful?

What are you getting from me that impedes your ability to
be effective?
What could I do for you that would help you to be more
successful?

Career Growth



To tease out a contributor’s career aspirations, a manager might
ask:

What skills or capabilities would you like to develop to
improve in your current role?
In what areas do you want to grow to achieve your career
goals?

What skills or capabilities would you like to develop for a
future role?
From a learning, growth, and development standpoint, how
can I and the company help you get there?

Prepping for Performance Conversations

Before launching a performance conversation with a contributor,
some prep work is in order. Specifically, leaders should consider the
following:

What were the contributor’s main objectives and
responsibilities in the period in question?

How has the contributor performed?
If the contributor is underperforming, how should he or she
course-correct?

If the contributor is performing well or exceeding
expectations, what can I do to sustain a high level of
performance without burnout?
When is the contributor most engaged?

When is the contributor least engaged?

What strengths does the contributor bring to the work?
What types of learning experience might benefit this
contributor?



Over the next six months, what should the contributor’s
focus be? Meeting expectations in his or her current role?
Maximizing contributions in the current role? Or preparing
for the next opportunity—be it a new project, expanded
responsibility, or new role?

Contributors, too, should prepare for performance conversations.
Specifically, they can ask themselves:

Am I on track to meet my objectives?

Have I identified areas of opportunity?
Do I understand how my work connects to broader
milestones?

What feedback can I give my manager?



RESOURCE 4

In Sum

Four Superpowers of OKRs
1. Focus and Commit to Priorities
2. Align and Connect for Teamwork
3. Track for Accountability
4. Stretch for Amazing

Continuous Performance Management Importance of Culture

Focus and Commit to Priorities

Set the appropriate cadence for your OKR cycle. I
recommend dual tracking, with quarterly OKRs (for shorter-
term goals) and annual OKRs (keyed to longer-term
strategies) deployed in parallel.
To work out implementation kinks and strengthen leaders’
commitment, phase in your rollout of OKRs with upper
management first. Allow the process to gain momentum
before enlisting individual contributors to join in.

Designate an OKR shepherd to make sure that every
individual devotes the time each cycle to choosing what
matters most.
Commit to three to five top objectives—what you need to
achieve—per cycle. Too many OKRs dilute and scatter
people’s efforts. Expand your effective capacity by deciding



what not to do, and discard, defer, or deemphasize
accordingly.

In choosing OKRs, look for objectives with the most leverage
for outstanding performance.
Find the raw material for top-line OKRs in the organization’s
mission statement, strategic plan, or a broad theme chosen
by leadership.

To emphasize a departmental objective and enlist lateral
support, elevate it to a company OKR.
For each objective, settle on no more than five measurable,
unambiguous, time-bound key results—how the objective will
be attained. By definition, completion of all key results
equates to the attainment of the objective.

For balance and quality control, pair qualitative and
quantitative key results.

When a key result requires extra attention, elevate it into an
objective for one or more cycles.
The single most important element for OKR success is
conviction and buy-in by the organization’s leaders.

Align and Connect for Teamwork

Incentivize employees by showing how their objectives relate
to the leader’s vision and the company’s top priorities. The
express route to operating excellence is lined with
transparent, public goals, on up to the CEO.

Use all-hands meetings to explain why an OKR is important
to the organization. Then keep repeating the message until
you’re tired of hearing it yourself.
When deploying cascaded OKRs, with objectives driven from
the top, welcome give-and-take on key results from frontline



contributors. Innovation dwells less at a company’s center
than at its edges.

Encourage a healthy proportion of bottom-up OKRs—roughly
half.
Smash departmental silos by connecting teams with
horizontally shared OKRs. Cross-functional operations
enable quick and coordinated decisions, the basis for seizing
a competitive advantage.

Make all lateral, cross-functional dependencies explicit.
When an OKR is revised or dropped, see to it that all
stakeholders know about it.

Track for Accountability

To build a culture of accountability, install continuous
reassessment and honest and objective grading—and start at
the top. When leaders openly admit their missteps,
contributors feel freer to take healthy risks.

Motivate contributors less with extrinsic rewards and more
with open, tangible measures of their achievement.

To keep OKRs timely and relevant, have the designated
shepherd ride herd over regular check-ins and progress
updates. Frequent check-ins enable teams and individuals to
course-correct with agility, or to fail fast.
To sustain high performance, encourage weekly one-on-one
OKR meetings between contributors and managers, plus
monthly departmental meetings.

As conditions change, feel free to revise, add, or delete OKRs
as appropriate—even in mid-cycle. Goals are not written in
stone. It’s counterproductive to hold stubbornly to objectives
that are no longer relevant or attainable.



At the cycle’s end, use OKR grades plus subjective self-
assessments to evaluate past performance, celebrate
achievements, and plan and improve for the future. Before
pushing into the next cycle, take a moment to reflect upon
and savor what you’ve accomplished in the last one.

To keep OKRs up-to-date and on point, invest in a dedicated,
automated, cloud-based platform. Public, collaborative, real-
time goal-setting systems work best.

Stretch for Amazing

At the beginning of each cycle, distinguish between goals that
must be attained 100 percent (committed OKRs) and those
that are stretching for a Big Hairy Audacious Goal (a BHAG,
or aspirational OKR).
Establish an environment where individuals are free to fail
without judgment.

To stimulate problem solving and spur people to greater
achievement, set ambitious goals—even if it means some
quarterly targets will be missed. But don’t set the bar so high
that an OKR is obviously unrealistic. Morale suffers when
people know they can’t succeed.
To get leaps in productivity or innovation, follow Google’s
“Gospel of 10x” and replace incremental OKRs with
exponential ones. That’s how industries get disrupted and
categories reinvented.

Design stretch OKRs to fit the organization’s culture. A
company’s optimal “stretch” may vary over time, depending
on the operating needs of the coming cycle.

When a team fails to attain a stretch OKR, consider rolling
the objective over to the next cycle—assuming the goal is still
relevant.



Continuous Performance Management

To address issues before they become problems and give
struggling contributors the support they need, move from
annual performance management to continuous performance
management.
Unleash ambitious goal setting by divorcing forward-looking
OKRs from backward-looking annual reviews. Equating goal
attainment to bonus checks will invite sandbagging and risk-
averse behavior.

Replace competitive ratings and stack rankings with
transparent, strength-based, multidimensional criteria for
performance evaluations. Beyond the numbers, consider a
contributor’s team play, communication, and ambition in
goal setting.
Rely on intrinsic motivations—purposeful work and
opportunities for growth—over financial incentives. They’re
far more powerful.

To power positive business results, implement ongoing CFRs
(conversations, feedback, and recognition) in concert with
structured goal setting. Transparent OKRs make coaching
more concrete and useful. Continuous CFRs keep day-to-day
work on point and genuinely collaborative.

In performance-driving conversations between managers and
contributors, allow the contributor to set the agenda. The
manager’s role is to learn and coach.
Make performance feedback two-way, ad hoc, and
multidirectional, unconstrained by the org chart.

Use anonymous “pulse” surveys for real-time feedback on
particular operations or general morale.
Strengthen connections between teams and departments
with peer-to-peer feedback, in conjunction with cross-
functional OKRs.



Employ peer recognition to enhance employee engagement
and performance. For maximum impact, recognition should
be frequent, specific, highly visible, and tied to top-line
OKRs.

The Importance of Culture

Align top-line OKRs with an organization’s mission, vision,
and North Star values.

Convey cultural values by word, but most of all by deed.
Promote peak performance with collaboration and
accountability. When OKRs are collective, assign key results
to individuals—and hold them accountable.

To develop a high-motivation culture, balance OKR
“catalysts,” actions that support the work, with CFR
“nourishers,” acts of interpersonal support or even random
acts of kindness.
Use OKRs to promote transparency, clarity, purpose, and
big-picture orientation. Deploy CFRs to build positivity,
enthusiasm, stretch thinking, and daily improvement.

Be alert to the need to address cultural barriers, especially
issues of accountability and trust, before implementing
OKRs.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I n closing this edition of Measure What Matters, I feel an
overwhelming sense of gratitude. First, that I was so lucky to be
heir to Andy Grove’s system to amplify human potential. And

then to watch inspiring entrepreneurs, leaders, and teams adapt it
to reach for their dreams. I am also thankful for our great country
that rewards risk taking, something I never take for granted.

Most of all, I thank you, my readers, for your attention,
engagement, and feedback. I hope you’ll write to me at
john@whatmatters.com.

The coming-to-be of this book confirms my mantra that it takes a
team to win. From inception to finished product, I thank the
Portfolio/Penguin team that made it all possible: my publisher,
Adrian Zackheim, who foresaw its potential; my superlative editor,
Stephanie Frerich, who went so many extra miles and somehow
kept her good humor; and also Tara Gilbride, Olivia Peluso, and
Will Weisser. I am grateful as well to my agent, Myrsini
Stephanides, and my attorney, Peter Moldave. And to the skilled
and versatile Ryan Panchadsaram, whose insights and judgment
proved indispensable.

A special thank-you goes to the individuals who took time out of
their impossibly busy schedules to read the manuscript and offer
the feedback that made it so much better:

To Bing Gordon, who also introduced me to Debra Radabaugh,
who introduced me to Coach Campbell.

I thank Jonathan Rosenberg, who furnished so many perceptive
observations on the Google way of using OKRs and pointed me to
our “stretch” case studies.

Thanks to Laszlo Bock, a brilliant thought leader on goals,
continuous performance management, and culture. And to Dov
Seidman, the great business philosopher, for his wisdom on culture
and values.



Thank you Tom Friedman, Laurene Powell Jobs, Al Gore, Randy
Komisar and Sheryl Sandberg, friends with big brains and kind
hearts, who shared their unique values and wisdom on building
teams and institutions.

Thanks to Jim Collins, my favorite business author, whose data-
driven, crystalline thinking challenged and clarified my purpose. I
couldn’t have written this book had Jim not pointed the way
forward in his own groundbreaking work.

And I thank Walter Isaacson, biographer extraordinaire, whose
good counsel and advice were instrumental as Measure What
Matters began to take shape.

I’d also like to thank my partners at Kleiner Perkins, whose
commitment to entrepreneurs lifts me up every day: Mike Abbott,
Brook Byers, Eric Feng, Bing Gordon, Mamoon Hamid, Wen Hsieh,
Noah Knauf, Randy Komisar, Mary Meeker, Mood Rowghani, Ted
Schlein, and Beth Seidenberg. Also, thanks to Sue Biglieri, Alix
Burns, Juliet deBaubigny, Amanda Duckworth, Rouz Jazayeri, and
Scott Ryles. And a special thanks to Rae Nell Rhodes, Cindy Chang,
and Noelle Miraglia for their unflagging support, and Tina Case,
who found the photographs that brought this book to life.

The four OKR superpowers, supported and made meaningful by
CFRs, are the scaffolding for Measure What Matters. But this book
would be hollow without our insider stories to depict OKRs and
CFRs in real life and real time. So here is a special thanks to the
storytellers, who shared so generously from their experiences.

I want to start with the Gates Foundation team, past and present,
who are especially inspiring for the breathtaking scope and
lifesaving impact of their work. Thank you, Bill and Melinda, Patty
Stonesifer, Larry Cohen, Bridgitt Arnold, Sylvia Mathews Burwell,
Susan Desmond-Hellman, Mark Suzman, and Ankur Vora. Your
achievement will make its own epic book that we cannot wait to
read.

Thanks to our favorite Irish rock star, who has built a global
crusade to fight disease, poverty, and corruption. Thank you Bono
and your team of Jamie Drummond, David Lane, Lucy Matthew,
Bobby Shriver, Gayle Smith, and Ken Weber for your creation of
ONE.

Now, the Google gang merits special mention. Yes, Larry Page,
Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt have made Google the twenty-first-
century prototype for structured goal setting. Their resolve and



results with OKRs impressed even Andy Grove. But I would be
remiss not to recognize as well the 100,000-plus Google employees
and alumni who have spread the goals gospel globally. I particularly
thank Sundar Pichai, Susan Wojcicki, Jonathan Rosenberg, and
Cristos Goodrow. Also, Tim Armstrong, Raja Ayyagari, Shona
Brown, Chris Dale, Beth Dowd, Salar Kamangar, Winnie King, Rick
Klau, Shishir Mehrotra, Eileen Naughton, Ruth Porat, Brian
Rakowski, Prasad Setty, Ram Shriram, Esther Sun, Matt Susskind,
Astro Teller, and Kent Walker.

Intel’s past and present leaders were magnanimous with their
insights. Thank you to Gordon Moore, Les Vadasz, Eva Grove, Bill
Davidow, Dane Elliott, Jim Lally, and Casey Powell. Also to CEO
Brian Krzanich, Steve Rodgers, Kelly Kelly, and to Terry Murphy,
Andy Grove’s longtime executive assistant.

one else while working better themselves every day.

Not least, I’d like to thank some special individuals with whom
I’ve been privileged to work over the years, and whose lives are
exemplars of excellence. Notable among them: Jim Barksdale, Andy
Bechtolsheim, Jeff Bezos, Scott Cook, John Chambers, Bill Joy, and
KR Sridhar. And Andy Grove, Bill Campbell, and Steve Jobs, gone
but never to be forgotten.

I sincerely thank Jeff Coplon, who was at the center of the team
that made this happen—and who proved, once again, that execution
is everything.

Long before I encountered OKRs, my father and hero, Lou Doerr,
taught me the value of focus, commitment, high standards, and
higher aspirations (and RMA—the Right Mental Attitude). My
mother, Rosemary Doerr, gave me her unconditional support to put
those lessons into practice.

Finally, I offer my undying gratitude to my wife, Ann, and
daughters, Mary and Esther, whose patience, encouragement, and
love kept me going through this long and challenging project. Each
and every day, they remind me of what matters the most.

* The rare exceptions are true disruptors. Exhibit B: The iPod, which lagged at least nine other digital
audio players into commercial production. Within three years, it gulped more than 70 percent of the
market.



* In 2001, at my suggestion, the founders recruited Eric Schmidt, my old colleague at Sun Microsystems,
to be their CEO. Eric made the trains run on time and broke the ties. Then I introduced Bill Campbell to
coach all three of them.



* I’d personally learned this drill at Intel in the 1970s. Gordon Moore, the legend who preceded Andy
Grove as Intel’s CEO, would say, “I view this year’s failure as next year’s opportunity to try it again.”



* As Steven Levy wrote in In the Plex, “Doerr had Google at metrics.”



* In the very beginning, Google relied on “snippets,” three- or four-line status reports on each
individual’s work.



* Google originally used quarterly OKRs, then added annual OKRs for a two-track process. Since
succeeding Larry Page as CEO, Sundar Pichai has shifted to a one-track, annual framework. To keep the
process vital and time-bound goals on track, each department reports its progress quarterly or
sometimes every six weeks—de facto key results. Now CEO of Alphabet, Larry sees to it that OKRs are
used at the parent company’s other subsidiaries. And he still writes his own individual OKRs each
quarter.



* I had learned on the PDP-11, the enthusiast’s minicomputer of choice.



* As did Stanford University, where he gave one hundred hours of his life each year to sixty graduate
business students.



* A video of Grove’s seminar can be found at www.whatmatters.com/grove.



* Imagine a mild Hungarian accent, which Grove never quite lost.



* A more progressive model, mostly ignored at the time, was advanced by a Massachusetts social worker
named Mary Parker Follett. In her essay “The Giving of Orders” (1926), Follett proposed that power
sharing and collaborative decision making between managers and employees led to better business
solutions. Where Taylor and Ford saw hierarchy, Follett saw networks.



* Emphasis added.



* We can see Grove’s influence on Steve Jobs, with whom he had a very close and very complicated
relationship.



* The name was inspired by the Denver Broncos’ smothering “Orange Crush” defense of the late 1970s.



* Of Intel’s two thousand employees at the time, more than half were detailed to Crush. Everybody else
was on call.



* As observed by Andy Grove in High Output Management.



* Or as Sheryl Sandberg says: “Done is better than perfect.”



* For a more comprehensive manual, see “Google’s OKR Playbook,” in the resource section at the back of
this book.



* Usually this will apply to a key result, or how you’re going about something. A thoughtfully set objective
is less likely to implode within ninety days.



* Google’s floor of 0.7 for successful attainment reflects the high ambition of their “stretch” goals. (See
chapter 12.) This threshold does not apply to the company’s committed operational goals. For sales
targets or product releases, any score under 1.0 would be deemed a failure.



* This KR reflects the awesome, compounding power of Moore’s law. Eight megahertz was blazing speed
at the time, but today you can buy a $300 Chromebook that runs better than two gigahertz—250 times
faster.



* As the Gates Foundation made a series of eight-figure grant awards to the Carter Center, the number of
reported cases of Guinea worm disease dropped from 75,223 in 2000 to 4,619 in 2008 to just 22 in 2015.
Dracunculiasis, its scientific name, is now expected to become the second disease in human history to be
